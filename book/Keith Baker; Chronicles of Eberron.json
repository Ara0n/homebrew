						"As I write these words, it's been almost twenty years since I first began exploring the world of Eberron in my mind. Over these two decades, a part of me has always been thinking about Eberron, considering all the questions the official books never had time and space to answer. What's the history of Dor Maleer? Just how smart are Karrnathi undead? Why so barren, Barren Sea?",
						"In the days before the Dungeon Masters Guild, there was no opportunity to create new Eberron content. I couldn't legally release new lore or mechanics—but I {@i could} answer questions. I started doing just that on my website, {@link Keith-Baker.com|www.keith-baker.com}, and over the years, I've written hundreds of articles. But that quantity is a blessing and a curse; some topics are more generally useful than others, but they're needles in a very large haystack. Beyond those questions and answers, I couldn't give players and Dungeon Masters new tools to work with until the Dungeon Masters Guild opened up Eberron for new creations.",
						"These pages you hold in your hands—or, potentially, these pixels you see on your screen—contain the answers to some of my favorite questions. This book blends practical advice (\"How do I start a new campaign? How do I handle travel?\") and deep lore detailing topics like the Twister of Roots and the gnomes of Lorghalan. In compiling this book, I've revised some of my articles and expanded others; even if you've read everything I've written, you'll find things here you've never seen before. And thanks to the excellent work of Imogen Gingell, we've added further depth and concrete mechanics to many ideas I previously only explored as stories. Because of her collaboration on this book, you can fight the daelkyr Avassh or wield the forbidden magic of the Shadow",
						"What lies ahead evolved from questions I've answered and how I've run things in my own personal campaign. Remember that what you're hearing in these pages is my personal voice. As fans have come to call it over the years, this book is \"kanon\"; in addition to being far less formal than canonical material, details in this book may contradict canon sources. One of the core principles of Eberron is that canon should serve as an inspiration, not a restriction on the stories you want to tell—and that applies to me as much as it does to you! What you have here is an account of what I'm doing \"in my Eberron.\" I hope it will inspire you, but never let anything I say stop you from telling a story you want to tell in your Eberron.",
						"And now, let's dive into the {@i Chronicles of Eberron}!",

This book is divided into two parts, each with a series of short chapters (well, most of them ...) designed for quick reading and easy reference.",
						"{@book Part 1: The Library|ChroniclesofEberron|5}  contains material that's widely useful to all readers. These chapters explore things that are either common knowledge or that any character could reasonably know about. For example, a Dungeon Master might craft adventures using the chapters about the gnomes of Lorghalan and Pylas Pyrial ... or a player might use the same information to create a gnome character from one of these locations. Similarly, a DM could read about the traditions of Galifar's nobility before introducing their duke NPC—meanwhile, the player of a noble character might review the same information before meeting that duke.",
						"{@book Part 2: The Vault|ChroniclesofEberron|14} is primarily designed for Dungeon Masters and adventure creators. In these pages, you'll find deadly monsters and dangerous places that are unlikely to fit into a player character's background. Anyone can read these chapters, of course ... but beware the spoilers that lie ahead! Even though some players may know the secrets of Ashtakala or the Twister of Roots, it's unlikely their characters do."

People living in a region probably have common knowledge about the things that impact their lives there—the people of the Mror Holds don't know much about the daelkyr in general, but they {@i do} know about Dyrrn the Corruptor, because they've been fighting him for decades and he signed his name with Dyrrn's Promise in 943 YK.",

Is Malleon's Gate named after a pirate or a king? What was the name of the city whose foundations lie beneath Sharn? Fun as this is, it's not just a game; for the professor, it's a long-term project to measure how general knowledge has spread across the people of Sharn—and to identify flaws in the educational system. In this year's challenge, only one in ten contestants knew which Tavick was the namesake of Tavick's Landing; more concerning was a continuing decline in familiarity with the customs and geography of the nations beyond Breland. \"The war built walls between us,\" Hass Holan says. \"If we truly hope to reunite Galifar, we need to ensure we remember our common history and culture.\""

										"Prior to the Last War, local law enforcement commonly worked with templars to combat supernatural threats. However, the Last War undermined trust in the templars (though most people understand that templars are devoted to their faith rather than to Thrane); today, the level of cooperation between templars and local authorities varies from place to place. Most people— including those devoted to the Silver Flame—don't know the actual origins of the Silver Flame; they recognize couatls as divine servants of the Silver Flame, but not as its creators. The faithful believe the Silver Flame is a celestial force strengthened by noble souls, while many Vassals assert the Sovereigns created the Flame.",
										"The doctrine of the Church of the Silver Flame doesn't deny the existence of the Sovereigns, and it's entirely possible—although uncommon—to follow both religions simultaneously. Similarly, most Silver Flame templars are happy to work with paladins of the Host. At the end of the day, the Church of the Silver Flame doesn't care if the Sovereigns exist. Flamic creed maintains that if they do exist, they are vast powers that maintain their individual domains in the world: Arawai makes sure there's rain for the crops, while Onatar watches over foundries. That's all great, but someone has to deal with the ghouls in the graveyard. So the church doesn't teach anything about the Sovereigns, and it doesn't encourage its followers to believe in the Sovereigns or incorporate them into its services—but it doesn't specifically deny the Sovereigns exist or forbid followers from holding both beliefs.",
										"Along the same lines, the Church of the Silver Flame doesn't have a unique creation myth; to them, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where the world itself came from. Beyond all else, the faith is practical: supernatural evil exists, it threatens the world, and good people should work together to fight it. Compared to our own world, the Church of the Silver Flame is more like the Jedi or the Men in Black than any of our religions. The Silver Flame is a real, concrete source of celestial energy that can empower champions to fight evil. Noble souls strengthen the Flame after death, so be virtuous—and if you want to believe in higher beings beyond that, feel free. What's important is to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, and faith in the Flame will help you to do that."

						"As I write these words, it's been almost twenty years since I first began exploring the world of Eberron in my mind. Over these two decades, a part of me has always been thinking about Eberron, considering all the questions the official books never had time and space to answer. What's the history of Dor Maleer? Just how smart are Karrnathi undead? Why so barren, Barren Sea?",
						"In the days before the Dungeon Masters Guild, there was no opportunity to create new Eberron content. I couldn't legally release new lore or mechanics—but I {@i could} answer questions. I started doing just that on my website, {@link Keith-Baker.com|www.keith-baker.com}, and over the years, I've written hundreds of articles. But that quantity is a blessing and a curse; some topics are more generally useful than others, but they're needles in a very large haystack. Beyond those questions and answers, I couldn't give players and Dungeon Masters new tools to work with until the Dungeon Masters Guild opened up Eberron for new creations.",
						"These pages you hold in your hands—or, potentially, these pixels you see on your screen—contain the answers to some of my favorite questions. This book blends practical advice (\"How do I start a new campaign? How do I handle travel?\") and deep lore detailing topics like the Twister of Roots and the gnomes of Lorghalan. In compiling this book, I've revised some of my articles and expanded others; even if you've read everything I've written, you'll find things here you've never seen before. And thanks to the excellent work of Imogen Gingell, we've added further depth and concrete mechanics to many ideas I previously only explored as stories. Because of her collaboration on this book, you can fight the daelkyr Avassh or wield the forbidden magic of the Shadow",

Similarly, a DM could read about the traditions of Galifar's nobility before introducing their duke NPC—meanwhile, the player of a noble character might review the same information before meeting that duke.",

In these pages, you'll find deadly monsters and dangerous places that are unlikely to fit into a player character's background.

Even though some players may know the secrets of Ashtakala or the Twister of Roots, it's unlikely their characters do."

Most people— including those devoted to the Silver Flame—don't know the actual origins of the Silver Flame; they recognize couatls as divine servants of the Silver Flame, but not as its creators.

That's all great, but someone has to deal with the ghouls in the graveyard. So the church doesn't teach anything about the Sovereigns, and it doesn't encourage its followers to believe in the Sovereigns or incorporate them into its services—but it doesn't specifically deny the Sovereigns exist or forbid followers from holding both beliefs.",

Beyond all else, the faith is practical: supernatural evil exists, it threatens the world, and good people should work together to fight it. Compared to our own world, the Church of the Silver Flame is more like the Jedi or the Men in Black than any of our religions. The Silver Flame is a real, concrete source of celestial energy that can empower champions to fight evil. Noble souls strengthen the Flame after death, so be virtuous—and if you want to believe in higher beings beyond that, feel free. What's important is to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, and faith in the Flame will help you to do that."

We're days away from the Eleventh Century and you're still shooting people with pointed sticks?\" So in 998 YK, Eberron is nearing the point where a soldier could just as plausibly be a leather-clad, wand-wielding warlock as they could be a fighter in plate with sword and shield—but for now, armies still clash with sword and spear.",
								"With that said, Eberron's central concept is that of a world whose progress is driven by magic, not science. Eberron has trains, yes—but they don't use steam or gears, they're a series of stagecoaches that ride a line of lightning. Eberron is not our world, and while the tools its people use may have names we consider medieval, that doesn't mean they are medieval in form or function.",
								"Heavy armor became obsolete in our world because crossbows and gunpowder weapons could easily penetrate it, and because the protective value of the armor no longer offset its limitations on movement. But in fifth edition, this isn't the case: regardless of whether your attacker is using a sword, heavy crossbow, or firearm, plate armor provides more protection than leather armor, and it's remarkably flexible (though noisy), imposing no penalties on Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) checks and the like. You can choose to attribute these qualities to the limitations of a streamlined rules system—but I prefer to embrace the idea that this isn't medieval armor. Though made of heavy plates and requiring Strength to use it effectively, plate armor needn't be medieval in material or appearance.",
								"The same concept applies to other \"medieval\" things. Orien couriers use special {@item horseshoes of speed}, channeling the power of their dragonmark to give a mount greater speed and durability. So yes, people are riding horses instead of motorcycles, but that Orien courier can tear past you with blue light flashing from their horse's hooves! On rare occasions, you might even see a courier with {@item horseshoes of a zephyr} riding a horse across the surface of a river. Eberron is a magical world; rather than thinking \"they don't have cars, the world is primitive,\" highlight what they've developed instead. Describe a squad of Vadalis hippogriffs passing overhead or a street performer weaving wonders out of illusion; it's not {@i medieval}, it's {@i magical}."

Leather and studded leather can be designed to be stylish and comfortable, and many former soldiers wear a modified form of their service armor.

By contrast, a light crossbow in D&D can fire ten bolts per minute with enough damage to drop a commoner with one shot. So while it's no match for modern automatic weapons, the light crossbow is far from medieval.",

The soldiers of Galifar I used medieval-style crossbows, with more limited range and a slow crank to reload; the superior crossbows used today are the result of centuries of engineering. Similarly, the Dhakaani and the Five Nations use highly effective modern crossbows, but when out in some Lhazaar backwater or fighting the Carrion Tribes, adventurers might encounter inferior weapons. You could represent this simply through how you describe a weapon's aesthetics; or if you want to represent it mechanically, perhaps reloading such a crossbow requires a bonus action, and you can't move and reload on the same turn. An even more limited design could reflect a slow crank mechanism by requiring an action to reload rather than a bonus action, reinforcing that this weapon is inferior to what the adventurers are used to."

												"Consider the line of crossbows produced by House Cannith (see \"{@book Crossbows of the Five Nations|ChroniclesofEberron|7|Crossbows of the Five Nations}\"). Cannith's crossbow barrel interior and quarrels are both engraved with arcane sigils. When the quarrel moves against the barrel, the symbols create an arcane interaction—a formula that adds kinetic energy to the bolt. With this in mind, the only force the bow itself has to provide is the initial push of the bolt down the barrel, a spark that triggers the arcane interaction. It's much easier to reload a Cannith crossbow than a medieval one because Cannith's bow itself is actually weaker; the weapon's power needn't depend on the tension of the bow.",

Thus the Spark hand crossbow has a shorter range, while the Thunderbolt heavy crossbow is the largest and longest weapon. In these crossbows, the \"bow\" is a relatively small component of the weapon. In many ways, these weapons resemble firearms, but their force isn't coming from a chemical reaction, but an arcane one.",
												"When using such a crossbow or other ranged weapon, there's nothing stopping you from describing it propelling its ammunition through the air via an arcane reaction. Just remember this doesn't change a crossbow's game mechanics; it's not a magic weapon, so it doesn't bypass damage resistance or register on the {@spell detect magic} spell. (If you take the existence of a minor enchantment to its logical conclusion, an {@spell antimagic field} spell would theoretically suppress the magical reaction and render the weapon useless in that area—but this 8th-level spell is far beyond the everyday magical effects the people of Khorvaire expect to encounter, so this isn't something crossbow manufacturers are worried about.)"

At the same time, we wanted to highlight the steady rise of industrial power and the shifting balance of power between the dragonmarked houses and the established aristocracy.

Galifar's semi-feudal status quo certainly hasn't remained unchallenged for the last thousand years; though prior books don't discuss much of what happened in that millennium, it had its share of uprisings, social experiments, and other remarkable events. As {@loader Exploring Eberron|collection/Keith Baker%3B Exploring Eberron.json} mentions in the \"Untold History\" section of {@book chapter 1|ExploringEberron|1}, the world's history is full of vast periods that were intentionally left unwritten, letting the DM decide what story to tell.",

In the wake of the Last War, nobles continue working to repair the damage to their domains, to reintegrate soldiers into civilian life, to deal with the impact of casualties, and to address the needs of refugees seeking shelter in their lands.

Your blood grants you prestige, but you neither carry the responsibilities of your rank nor have access to the full resources of your domain.",

								"The culture of the Five Nations blends the united traditions of Galifar with the preserved traditions of each nation. The Last War was fought not for independence from Galifar, but in an attempt to reunite it and determine who would rule the united kingdom. With a few notable exceptions (Thrane's theocracy, the Code of Kaius), the Five Nations intentionally preserved the traditions of Galifar, always hoping that within a few years, their ruler would be the sovereign of the reunited Galifar.",
								"While Galifar was a united kingdom, it wasn't a monolithic culture. Throughout its history, the people of Galifar maintained pride in their individual cultures, thinking of themselves as distinct nationalities even while considering themselves citizens of Galifar. A millennium ago, King Galifar Wynarn I—then king of Karrnath—began his campaign to unite the Five Nations by conquering the neighboring kingdom of Metrol. There, Galifar displaced existing nobles and instituted new systems, drastically transforming (and renaming) it as he made Cyre the heart of his new kingdom of Galifar. The other three nations were ultimately brought into Galifar by diplomacy, not by absolute conquest—though Galifar's clear military superiority was the iron fist that drove these negotiations. Galifar I instituted changes at the highest levels of society, appointing his children as the rulers of each nation; but rather than displacing the existing nobility, he generally married his children into the current ruling families.",
								"Galifar built on the existing feudal structures of the Five Nations, but restructured them so it was clear all power ultimately flowed from the sovereign. Over time, he streamlined systems and added new universal concepts, such as expanding education and instituting the Galifar Code of Justice. Meanwhile, he nationalized and advanced the role of institutions such as the Arcane Congress, the King's Citadel, and Rekkenmark. He instituted a standardized currency—the crown-sovereign-galifar-dragon values still used today—and established the Karrnathi dialect as the Common tongue. So all the nations of Galifar were united by a vital set of shared customs and laws, but they also maintained their own unique traditions and quirks, highlighted in the \"{@book Nations and Nobles Today|ChroniclesofEberron|8|nations and nobles today}\" section.",

Galifar I believed he was guided by Aureon and fulfilling a destiny laid out by that Sovereign; given the king's remarkable successes, it's entirely possible he was a paladin of the Host, possibly even a subtle aasimar. The belief that the Wynarn bloodline is blessed by Aureon is a vital cornerstone of the Galifar monarchy. This bedrock principle has stood against uprisings, would-be usurpers, and consorts seeking to claim the crown. In the present day, this belief doesn't come up often and modern monarchs vary in their piety, but it still underlies the traditions of Galifar. The Galifar Code of Justice invokes Aureon, and other aspects of law similarly assume a casual faith in the Sovereigns.",
										"While the faith of the Sovereign Host permeates the Five Nations, it has never been an institution wielding monolithic power like the Church of the Silver Flame does in Thrane. But just as nobles are required to maintain courts, collect taxes, and levy troops within their domains, they're required to sustain the Vassal faith. Depending on the size of a community, this could involve maintaining a grand temple, a small temple with a single priest, or just a small shrine. Most nobles of Galifar viewed this not as a hardship, but an opportunity to display piety; they might lavish resources on their favored temples, raise monuments or shrines to a particular Sovereign, or compete to lure the most accomplished scholars to their seminaries. Within the Sovereign faith, anyone seen as guided by the Nine can fill the role of priest, so some renowned nobles have even acted as priests of the Sovereign Host.",
										"Throughout the untold history of Galifar, some zealous nobles sought to stamp out divergent sects—hunting down and publicly executing followers of the Dark Six (real or imagined) or persecuting \"heretics.\" However, despite his deep faith, Galifar never sought to force his beliefs on others. His kingdom's principles presumed simple faith in the Sovereigns and nobles were required to support the faith—but they and their people weren't required to actually practice it. Following his legacy, the Five Nations are largely tolerant to this day (and many of its monarchs aren't particularly devout), but the principle of Aureon's Blessing remains at the heart of the myth of Galifar."

Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for collecting taxes and providing military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. All power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses who governed the land, down to local nobles and administrators. Throughout the united kingdom of Galifar, the nobility remained its foundation. They were still responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service.",
										"Under the Galifar Code of Justice, nobles didn't administer justice personally, but it was their duty to maintain the system, which included appointing justices and managing the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners—initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, most lands were still associated with a noble's domain, and the local lord still appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to their count, the count to their duke, the duke to their prince, and the prince to their king.",

These are a great option for a DM to award to player characters, allowing them to enjoy the status of being a count or shield of the realm without having to give up adventuring and begin maintaining roads and collecting taxes.

While conscription was practiced in the kingdom's early days (a task often delegated to the counts of a duchy), in time, it became common practice for nobles in peaceful regions to pay for Karrnathi troops to enlist in their name.

												"Under the traditions of Galifar, a hereditary title passes to the oldest child of that noble. If there is no living heir, the title passes to the noble's siblings or the siblings' heirs; failing that, the noble who oversees the deceased's domain has the power to reassign it, though that appointment must be ratified by the sovereign. Several noble lines were lost in the Last War (or convicted of treason and stripped of rank), so there are dukes with counties to dispense and counts in need of qualified crown reeves.",
												"In most of the Five Nations, marriage doesn't convey title (other than the prewar practice of elevating the ruler of a duchy to archduke or archduchess when they married a prince or princess). This stems from the principle that only a Wynarn can rule; when the Wynarn monarch dies, their consort has no claim to the throne. Often, a noble consort is granted a courtesy title, as seen with Queen Etrigani of Karrnath; but if Kaius III were to die, the crown of Karrnath would immediately pass to his eldest heir, not to Etrigani. This principle generally holds throughout the ranks. Someone who marries into a noble family is a consort. They may be granted a courtesy title (see \"{@book Honors and Offices|ChroniclesofEberron|8|Honors and Offices}\"), but they're not the equal of their noble spouse—and if they're a player character, it's up to the DM to decide whether their status is sufficient to justify a Position of Privilege. This largely depends on public perception: do the nobles and common folk respect the consort ?",
												"While many nobles limit themselves to a single consort, this isn't enforced by law. A monarch could have multiple consorts, and any child with an official consort (whether by marriage or simple royal decree) is considered an heir. For hundreds of years, it was accepted tradition for a reigning sovereign to have a consort from each of the Five Nations, in part to spread out the burden of producing five heirs. In the wake of the Last War, some nobles have continued this tradition. For example, Kaius III of Karrnath maintains a harem; only Etrigani carries the formal title of queen, but it's possible Kaius has named other partners as consorts. By contrast, Queen Aurala of Aundair has a single consort, but hasn't granted him the title of king.",
												"In most nations of Khorvaire, only the sovereign can create a new title. However, many domains have a set of existing courtesy titles (see \"{@book Honors and Offices|ChroniclesofEberron|8|Honors and Offices}\") that can be dispensed at the discretion of the local noble. For example, the Count of Threeshadows may have the authority to appoint a Viscount Threeshadows and two knights—but these titles aren't passed on to heirs.",
												"In most nations, it's illegal for anyone to sell a title, whether it's their own or a domain within their jurisdiction; Breland is a notable exception to this rule."

										"In addition to the noble titles above, the Five Nations use many other titles that are honors or offices. Similar to the courtesy titles of nobility, these titles signify status but aren't hereditary and don't bestow land.",
										"For example, knighthood (discussed further below) is an honor, not a title of nobility. Traditionally, a duke or higher noble can appoint a knight to reward them for their service to the nation. While there were Karrnathi nobles among the original Order of the Emerald Claw, many knights of the order came from the gentry. On the other hand, among the Karrnathi chivalric orders, the Order of the Inviolate Way only accepts members who are also of noble blood.",
										"Offices include titles like \"Minister of Magic\" or \"Warlord.\" For example, in Aundair, Darro ir'Lain is the Duke of Passage and Second Warlord of the Realm. His title of duke is hereditary, but his second title is an office he currently holds, not something he carries for life. If he fell out of favor with Queen Aurala, there would soon be a new Second Warlord.",

												"By the traditions of Galifar, knights are associated with orders. A knight isn't just a knight; they're a Knight of the Order of the Emerald Claw, or a Knight of the Order of the Inviolate Way. Knightly orders serve three functions. First, a knighthood is an honor reflecting the favor of a sovereign, duke, or lesser noble granted the privilege of appointing knights. Additionally, knightly orders are fraternal orders, and members are expected to support one another in both war and peace. Finally, knightly orders are also elite military units.",
												"Though knights usually serve as elite warriors, that's not always the case; this is similar to how most nobles have substantive titles (with formal responsibilities), whereas others are titled as a courtesy. The Duchess of Karrlakton might appoint one woman as a Knight of the Order of the Blackened Sky because she's an exceptional combat alchemist whose skills will serve Karrnath well on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the duchess might appoint another man to the same order for entirely different reasons: he's an influential citizen of Karrlakton, and she wants both to honor his service and connect him to other members of the order, even though she understands he's not a soldier and will never serve the order on the battlefield.",
												"Sometimes a knighthood comes with an annuity, making it a concrete reward that can help support a non-noble knight. But beyond that, the knighthood's function as a supportive fraternal order comes into play. In the example given above, the combat alchemist may not be a noble nor have significant wealth. Meanwhile, the second knight is wealthy and could serve as a patron to the alchemist. The orders are designed to bring the finest citizens together, people who might normally be split by class lines. Knighthood allows nobles to elevate and forge connections with gifted commoners without actually raising them to the nobility. ({@i Forge of War} presents the most detailed description of knightly orders in canon material, describing six Karrnathi orders on page 54.)"

To date, this has gone unchallenged, in part because it's not entirely clear who would challenge it and in what forum.",
												"Further complicating matters, though dragonmarked heirs have to abandon house ties to marry into noble families, they bring their blood with them—and consequently, there have been nobles who carried dragonmarks. That said, dragonmarks appear most frequently in the dragonmarked houses due to intentional mingling of strong dragonmarked bloodlines. If someone from those bloodlines marries an outsider, a dragonmark is far less likely. As a result, foundling marks are quite rare, and someone who unexpectedly develops a mark may not even realize that they had a connection to a house in their history. So while dragonmarked nobles are possible, they're by no means common."

										"Citizens of the Five Nations are protected by the Code of Galifar. But how does one become a citizen? Keeping in mind that Galifar is based on feudal principles, most nations still require would-be citizens to attend an audience with a local noble. There, the applicant swears fealty to the nation, its ruler, and that local noble; in turn, the noble formally accepts them as a subject. In doing so, the noble accepts responsibility for that individual, and the individual promises to obey that noble, pay taxes, answer any call for conscription, and respect the laws of the land.",
										"Nobles don't have to accept an offer of fealty, and most won't unless the potential subject intends to reside within their domain. For example, a Brelish noble might refuse to accept the fealty of an ogre from Droaam—perhaps because they don't believe the ogre will uphold the laws, or because they don't believe the ogre intends to remain within their domain. And without an accepted oath of fealty, you have none of the privileges of a citizen. Long before the people of the Barrens established Droaam, Galifar I declared the land to be part of Breland's domain—but the region's monstrous inhabitants had never sworn fealty to any Brelish lord. As a result, they weren't considered citizens, and from Galifar's perspective, they were outlaws squatting in Brelish land.",
										"In the modern age, much of the citizenship process is streamlined and standardized by bureaucracy, especially when granting citizenship to children of existing citizens. In some regions, there are annual ceremonies where each youth swears an oath to the local lord before being recognized as an adult. In a populous region like Sharn, the parents file paperwork when the child is born, and when the child becomes an adult, they file their own statement. But the underlying principle remains the same: {@i someone} needs to make a decision on behalf of the local lord as to whether to accept the offer of fealty, based on the applicant's residence, reputation, family, and other factors."

Breland was an active frontier, and its people were more concerned with practical protection than with who was doing the protecting. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, while goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. Zilargo's grand duchies were quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders.

										"Even before becoming Thrane under Galifar I, the city-state of Daskara was devoted to worship of the Sovereign Host, reflecting the influence of ancient Pyrine (and to a lesser extent, Irian). Just as Karrnath has powerful manifest zones tied to Mabar, Daskara has a few noteworthy zones tied to Irian, which inspire hope and encourage faith; notably, one of these zones is in the region where Flamekeep now stands. Like Galifar I's belief in the Wynarn family's right to rule, the people of Daskara believed their own rulers were blessed by the Sovereigns and governed with divine right. This faith was shaken by their defeats at the hands of Galifar's forces, but he was able to convince most that his united kingdom was part of the divine plan, that their blessed lords were meant to kneel to the Wynarn monarch. Galifar further strengthened this by establishing Daskara as the seat of the Grand Temple of the Host, the greatest temple in the lands. However, divine will was called into question when the dragon Sarmondelaryx ravaged the newly christened Thrane, killing its prince and burning the Grand Temple.",
										"These challenges strained the faith of the Thranes, but it took the overlord Bel Shalor to shatter it. Neither a prince nor the Sovereigns saved the nation from his terror, but a warrior of lowly birth, strengthened by courage and the power of the Silver Flame. In the years and centuries that followed, the people of Thrane largely abandoned the Sovereign Host and embraced the Silver Flame. Bel Shalor's forces had destroyed the Grand Temple of the Host, and the people chose to replace it with the citadel of Flamekeep. This moved the seat of the Vassal faith out of Thrane and to the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host in Metrol.",
										"These changes left the nobles of Thrane in an odd position. They had long touted their supposed divine blessing, but now their people were shifting away from the faith that supported it. Many nobles responded to this by embracing the Silver Flame, sharing the faith of the people, and acknowledging the power that saved their nation. Others sought to balance both traditions; after all, even if the Grand Temple was never rebuilt, the faith of the Silver Flame didn't actually deny the possibility the Sovereigns might exist and might have blessed the noble lines. And a few nobles clung bitterly to the old ways, refusing to acknowledge the new faith and struggling to limit the power of its church within their domains.",

The lands once held through the crown were now considered the property of the church, and the church claimed authority over most civil and military matters previously administered by nobles. The roles of viscounts and blood regents were dissolved and taken over by church functionaries. Higher nobles were allowed to retain a single manor and estate, but no more.",
												"Many nobles chose to work with the church, helping with the transition and earning a place within the theocracy through faith and service. Others were willing to remain in a decorative ceremonial role—a position Queen Diani ir'Wynarn finds herself in today. In theory, she is the Blood Regent and serves as advisor to the Keeper and the Cardinals. In practice, she is largely ignored. While she smiles at the services she attends, Diani believes that Aureon and Dol Arrah have plans for her, and there are loyalists—known as Throneholders— who dream of restoring Thrane's monarchy to its rightful place."

Beyond your retainers, your family still has an estate you can return to, but they have little influence or resources to spare. As a noble of Thrane, are you devoted to the Silver Flame, supporting the nation's new direction? Or are you a bitter Throneholder determined to restore the old order? For a more dramatic twist, you might believe you were chosen by one or more of the Sovereigns for some divine purpose; is this purpose the restoration of the nobility, or do the Sovereigns have a plan for you that doesn't place you at odds with the church?"

										"How does the Code of Galifar handle succession and inheritance when a noble dies... and then comes back? {@i Sharn: City of Towers} establishes that the Code of Galifar doesn't consider undead to be citizens, and undead nobles can't hold property. However, in a world with the {@spell revivify} spell, it's extreme to say that if someone is dead for less than a minute, they lose all their privileges. With this in mind, the common practice in the Five Nations is to observe a two-week grace period while the soul of the dead person is passing through Dolurrh. During these two weeks, they aren't legally dead. A dead noble's heir may immediately take up office to ensure the system keeps running, but a noble raised from the dead during that time retains all their rights and privileges.",
										"On the other hand, after a person has been dead for two weeks, they're legally dead, and the laws regarding inheritance and succession come into effect. A noble returned to life after this period is considered to be a new person with no claim to their old titles or property.

The former duke thus became the first king of New Galifar, despite not being tied to the Wynarn bloodline. The few counts who had supported his cause were named dukes, and wealthy donors who had funded the expedition became counts.",

Most Q'barran nobles are \"claim lords\"— they've been granted titles and parcels of land by the King of Q'barra, but they haven't actually claimed or cultivated those lands. Adderport and Newthrone together have a kingdom's worth of dukes and counts, but most only rule over a handful of retainers and a small city estate.",

However, this was largely a show for the rest of the world; the Valenar have never cared about holding land or titles, as the ancestors they emulate didn't rule petty fiefdoms.

The region was governed by triumvirate with a representative from each duchy. While ostensibly part of Breland, their status as grand duchies allowed them to largely remain autonomous. However, \"grand duke\" is a symbolic role that the Zil largely ignore, except during special interactions with nobles of Galifar.

In practicality, the Triumvirate, the Councils of Nine, and the Trust actually maintain the nation.",

In some accounts, Cyre ir'Wynarn was Galifar's oldest daughter, mere minutes ahead of her twin sister Aundair. In others, Cyre is described as Galifar's youngest son, who ruled as king after his father stepped down. Both accounts are true; as Princess Cyre, her vision of unity shaped her father's kingdom, and as King Cyre, he ascended to his throne.",
										"Galifar's twins, Aundair and Cyre, were the most mystically gifted of the Wynarns. Aundair specialized in evocation and conjuration; she negotiated with celestials and fiends, and brought down her enemies with storm and fire. Cyre was devoted to divination, illusion, and transmutation; their interest was always in understanding the true nature of a thing and exploring the ways it could be expressed. Where Aundair was bold and often reckless, Cyre was thoughtful and empathetic. The Cyran national motto is \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create\"—and this was Cyre ir'Wynarn's motto long before it was the nation's. They sought to understand the people of the Five Nations, and it was Cyre's vision of all five working together—of harnessing the best in all of them—that drove both the development of the nation and the foundation of the united kingdom of Galifar.",
										"Cyre's mastery of transmutation was unprecedented in the Five Nations. Their greatest creation was {@i Cyre's Mantle}, which used principles of transmutation and divination both to alter the form of the wearer and imbue them with new knowledge. Cyre didn't use the mantle as a disguise, but to create unique personas reflecting different aspects of their identity. Their subjects grew used to the \"Five Faces of Cyre,\" and Cyre considered each face to be as much their true nature as the one they were born with. Few who knew Cyre were surprised they chose to rule as King Cyre; this face's confident, decisive persona embodied his strongest leadership qualities. After his coronation, King Cyre used the mantle less often; he wanted the people to have a clear and consistent image of him as king, and only used other personas in private or with close advisors.",
										"Those who are familiar with changeling cultures may recognize elements of traveler philosophy in Cyre's use of personas. While the truth is buried beneath centuries, some tales relate Cyre's great respect for the Children of Jes as he helped them establish havens across the united kingdom. In some of these tales, Cyre didn't actually create {@i Cyre's Mantle}, but received it as a gift from the Traveler. Whatever the truth, both {@i Cyre's Mantle} and some of his advisors disappeared after the king's natural death; various legends tell of the mantle being used at various points in history, but its current location remains a mystery."

Their abilities could result from the curse of an archfey or exposure to a manifest zone's energies. Similarly, an owlin could've once been the owl familiar of an archmage teaching at Arcanix; when this wizard died, their last act was to give their faithful familiar independence and a humanoid form. In these examples, the player gets the abilities they want without the DM adding a new culture to the setting. This approach gives the opportunity to explore the character's relationship with their creator: Why did Mordain the Fleshweaver create a tabaxi? Was the character once his feline familiar? Did the character escape from Mordain, or were they released into the wild, and do they know why?"

Perhaps an entire village was caught in the Mourning and all its inhabitants transformed into tabaxi. Maybe House Vadalis magebred a unit of goliath supersoldiers during the war; the character escaped, but most of their kin are still held in a secret Vadalis facility. Or it's possible there are only a dozen kenku—they were servants of the archfey known as the {@creature The Forgotten Prince|ExploringEberron|Forgotten Prince}, and as punishment for a crime, he stole each kenku's voice and exiled them all to Eberron.",

The Lhazaar Principalities can work for this as well—if no one's ever met the Cloudreavers in your campaign, you can declare that they're goliaths (and always have been). They're rare enough that people don't know them in the Five Nations, and they didn't have a huge impact on the Last War, but they have an island, they have ships, and they're known across the Principalities.

Fey centaurs are neither limited to being half-horse nor half-human, and different tribes can vary drastically. For example, in the Eldeen Reaches, one tribe of centaurs is half-human, halfhorse—but another is half-deer, half-elf. If you look long enough, you might even find a tribe that's half-gnome, half-wolf! These cosmetic details don't affect their statistics, and aren't limited by genetics; while each tribe tends toward a common form, variations aren't unheard of, so the child of an elf-stag centaur could be a gnome-wolf.",

Over the last century, some have chosen to work with the Wardens of the Wood, and centaur cavalry supported the Eldeen secession. However, others prefer to remain in the deep woods and the Twilight Demesne, ignoring the violence and brutality of the world beyond the woods.",
												"Whichever path you take, as a centaur character, your ancestry is unusual but not unheard of. Why have you left your herd behind and chosen to walk on the hard roads of the two-footed? You could be associated with one of the druidic sects, carrying out a mission for the Wardens of the Wood or dealing with threats to Eldeen independence. Or you could just be driven by curiosity; as a centaur bard, you could be chasing a song you can't quite hear, but you know it's out there somewhere."

From that point forward it is the sacred duty of the child to become the living avatar of the fallen champion, mastering his or her skills and living by her code. The people of the Five Nations know little about the Tairnadal, and their general assumptions often don't make sense. Ask ten people in Sharn, and you'll hear that the Valenar are bloodthirsty brutes who love to pillage the weak; that they seek glory in battle and won't fight a weaker foe; that they are bound by a strict code of honor; that they have no honor; that every Valenar is bound to a horse; and so on. In fact, no one rule applies to every Tairnadal, for every ancestor demands a different role of his or her descendants. A child chosen by Maelian Steelweaver will spend his or her days forging swords instead of wielding them. One chosen by Silence will spend life in the shadows. War is the common thread that unites the Tairnadal, because the wars against giants, dragons, and goblins were what produced these legendary heroes. As such, the Tairnadal seek conflicts that will let them face the same odds and fight in the same style as their ancestors. Nowadays a child of Vadallia can't fight giants, because the Cul'sir Dominion has fallen, but they must search for a foe that is equally challenging and then defeat it in the same way Vadallia would, thus creating new legends in Vadallia's name."

						"As I write these words, it's been almost twenty years since I first began exploring the world of Eberron in my mind. Over these two decades, a part of me has always been thinking about Eberron, considering all the questions the official books never had time and space to answer. What's the history of Dor Maleer? Just how smart are Karrnathi undead? Why so barren, Barren Sea?",
						"In the days before the Dungeon Masters Guild, there was no opportunity to create new Eberron content. I couldn't legally release new lore or mechanics—but I {@i could} answer questions. I started doing just that on my website, {@link Keith-Baker.com|www.keith-baker.com}, and over the years, I've written hundreds of articles. But that quantity is a blessing and a curse; some topics are more generally useful than others, but they're needles in a very large haystack. Beyond those questions and answers, I couldn't give players and Dungeon Masters new tools to work with until the Dungeon Masters Guild opened up Eberron for new creations.",
						"These pages you hold in your hands—or, potentially, these pixels you see on your screen—contain the answers to some of my favorite questions. This book blends practical advice (\"How do I start a new campaign? How do I handle travel?\") and deep lore detailing topics like the Twister of Roots and the gnomes of Lorghalan. In compiling this book, I've revised some of my articles and expanded others; even if you've read everything I've written, you'll find things here you've never seen before. And thanks to the excellent work of Imogen Gingell, we've added further depth and concrete mechanics to many ideas I previously only explored as stories. Because of her collaboration on this book, you can fight the daelkyr Avassh or wield the forbidden magic of the Shadow",
						"What lies ahead evolved from questions I've answered and how I've run things in my own personal campaign. Remember that what you're hearing in these pages is my personal voice. As fans have come to call it over the years, this book is \"kanon\"; in addition to being far less formal than canonical material, details in this book may contradict canon sources. One of the core principles of Eberron is that canon should serve as an inspiration, not a restriction on the stories you want to tell—and that applies to me as much as it does to you! What you have here is an account of what I'm doing \"in my Eberron.\" I hope it will inspire you, but never let anything I say stop you from telling a story you want to tell in your Eberron.",
						"And now, let's dive into the {@i Chronicles of Eberron}!",

These chapters explore things that are either common knowledge or that any character could reasonably know about. For example, a Dungeon Master might craft adventures using the chapters about the gnomes of Lorghalan and Pylas Pyrial ... or a player might use the same information to create a gnome character from one of these locations. Similarly, a DM could read about the traditions of Galifar's nobility before introducing their duke NPC—meanwhile, the player of a noble character might review the same information before meeting that duke.",
						"{@book Part 2: The Vault|ChroniclesofEberron|14} is primarily designed for Dungeon Masters and adventure creators. In these pages, you'll find deadly monsters and dangerous places that are unlikely to fit into a player character's background. Anyone can read these chapters, of course ... but beware the spoilers that lie ahead! Even though some players may know the secrets of Ashtakala or the Twister of Roots, it's unlikely their characters do."

However, the Last War undermined trust in the templars (though most people understand that templars are devoted to their faith rather than to Thrane); today, the level of cooperation between templars and local authorities varies from place to place. Most people— including those devoted to the Silver Flame—don't know the actual origins of the Silver Flame; they recognize couatls as divine servants of the Silver Flame, but not as its creators. The faithful believe the Silver Flame is a celestial force strengthened by noble souls, while many Vassals assert the Sovereigns created the Flame.",

Similarly, most Silver Flame templars are happy to work with paladins of the Host. At the end of the day, the Church of the Silver Flame doesn't care if the Sovereigns exist. Flamic creed maintains that if they do exist, they are vast powers that maintain their individual domains in the world: Arawai makes sure there's rain for the crops, while Onatar watches over foundries. That's all great, but someone has to deal with the ghouls in the graveyard. So the church doesn't teach anything about the Sovereigns, and it doesn't encourage its followers to believe in the Sovereigns or incorporate them into its services—but it doesn't specifically deny the Sovereigns exist or forbid followers from holding both beliefs.",
										"Along the same lines, the Church of the Silver Flame doesn't have a unique creation myth; to them, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where the world itself came from. Beyond all else, the faith is practical: supernatural evil exists, it threatens the world, and good people should work together to fight it. Compared to our own world, the Church of the Silver Flame is more like the Jedi or the Men in Black than any of our religions. The Silver Flame is a real, concrete source of celestial energy that can empower champions to fight evil. Noble souls strengthen the Flame after death, so be virtuous—and if you want to believe in higher beings beyond that, feel free. What's important is to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, and faith in the Flame will help you to do that."

By contrast, a light crossbow in D&D can fire ten bolts per minute with enough damage to drop a commoner with one shot.

The soldiers of Galifar I used medieval-style crossbows, with more limited range and a slow crank to reload; the superior crossbows used today are the result of centuries of engineering. Similarly, the Dhakaani and the Five Nations use highly effective modern crossbows, but when out in some Lhazaar backwater or fighting the Carrion Tribes, adventurers might encounter inferior weapons. You could represent this simply through how you describe a weapon's aesthetics; or if you want to represent it mechanically, perhaps reloading such a crossbow requires a bonus action, and you can't move and reload on the same turn. An even more limited design could reflect a slow crank mechanism by requiring an action to reload rather than a bonus action, reinforcing that this weapon is inferior to what the adventurers are used to."

												"Consider the line of crossbows produced by House Cannith (see \"{@book Crossbows of the Five Nations|ChroniclesofEberron|7|Crossbows of the Five Nations}\"). Cannith's crossbow barrel interior and quarrels are both engraved with arcane sigils. When the quarrel moves against the barrel, the symbols create an arcane interaction—a formula that adds kinetic energy to the bolt. With this in mind, the only force the bow itself has to provide is the initial push of the bolt down the barrel, a spark that triggers the arcane interaction. It's much easier to reload a Cannith crossbow than a medieval one because Cannith's bow itself is actually weaker; the weapon's power needn't depend on the tension of the bow.",

Thus the Spark hand crossbow has a shorter range, while the Thunderbolt heavy crossbow is the largest and longest weapon. In these crossbows, the \"bow\" is a relatively small component of the weapon. In many ways, these weapons resemble firearms, but their force isn't coming from a chemical reaction, but an arcane one.",
												"When using such a crossbow or other ranged weapon, there's nothing stopping you from describing it propelling its ammunition through the air via an arcane reaction. Just remember this doesn't change a crossbow's game mechanics; it's not a magic weapon, so it doesn't bypass damage resistance or register on the {@i {@spell detect magic}} spell. (If you take the existence of a minor enchantment to its logical conclusion, an {@i {@spell antimagic field}} spell would theoretically suppress the magical reaction and render the weapon useless in that area—but this 8th-level spell is far beyond the everyday magical effects the people of Khorvaire expect to encounter, so this isn't something crossbow manufacturers are worried about.)"

												"I personally prefer to stick with enhanced crossbows, maintaining the game's balance while still presenting the party's crossbows as advanced weapons. If you do introduce firearms into a D&D game, here are some balance considerations.",
												"The {@filter Renaissance firearms|items|source=|type=renaissance|category=} are reasonably balanced against weapons from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}; for example, the {@item musket} deals more damage than the {@item heavy crossbow|PHB} but with a significantly shorter range. However, the Modern and Futuristic weapons significantly outshine standard weapons. The Modern hunting rifle inflicts twice the damage of a {@item heavy crossbow|PHB}, and a single shot from the Futuristic {@item antimatter rifle} deals as much damage as a 3rd-level {@spell inflict wounds} spell.",
												"With that in mind, if I added firearms to my campaign, only the {@filter Renaissance weapons|items|source=|type=renaissance|category=} weapons would be widespread. I'd treat {@filter Modern weapons|items|source=|type=modern|category=} like uncommon magic items (though notably, their damage doesn't bypass damage resistance like a magic weapon would), and give these weapons to the more technologically advanced cultures in Eberron. Perhaps Aerenal's elite Cairdal Blades have firearms driven by ectoplasm, or the tiefling lords of the Venomous Demesne use firearms harnessing the flames of Fernia. Meanwhile, the incredibly powerful {@filter Futuristic weapons|items|source=|type=futuristic|category=} would be unheard of, and as hard to come by as a very rare magic item."

								"As mentioned in the previous chapter, from the very beginning of the Eberron setting, one of the goals was to make sure the experience of adventuring in this new world still felt like D&D. Knights in plate armor still fight using swords and crossbows, and many nations are ruled by monarchs. At the same time, we wanted to highlight the steady rise of industrial power and the shifting balance of power between the dragonmarked houses and the established aristocracy. So while D&D is stereotypically medieval, our goal was to present a vision of a world that's actively evolving and straining against the past. Breland is already shifting well away from the medieval version of monarchy—and depending on how your story unfolds, other nations might be close behind.",
								"When making history, you always want to know why it matters. We wanted adventurers to be caught in the middle of these changes, to have to deal with the Swords of Liberty and overreaching houses, to have to decide whether to challenge tradition or defend it. So while the many medieval trappings of the Five Nations may seem incongruous, that's the intent— Eberron is a world actively caught between the traditional medievalism associated with D&D and the pull of social and industrial evolution. Galifar's semi-feudal status quo certainly hasn't remained unchallenged for the last thousand years; though prior books don't discuss much of what happened in that millennium, it had its share of uprisings, social experiments, and other remarkable events. As {@i {@loader Exploring Eberron|collection/Keith Baker%3B Exploring Eberron.json}} mentions in the \"Untold History\" section of {@book chapter 1|ExploringEberron|1}, the world's history is full of vast periods that were intentionally left unwritten, letting the DM decide what story to tell.",
								"For example, if it suits your story, it's entirely possible there was a thirty-year period in which Aundair broke away and existed as the Republic of Thaliost before being pulled back into Galifar; this early rebellion might've laid the foundation for the more successful secession of the Eldeen Reaches in the tenth century. As of 998 YK, there are still traces of medieval flavor in the culture of Galifar, but you can change these or explore untold moments of history if it makes your campaign more interesting."

								"What does it mean to be a noble? In most of the nations of Khorvaire, nobles actively govern a region, whether large or small. They collect taxes, maintain lands, and manage tenants. Nobles may not personally administer justice, but within their domains, they're still responsible for maintaining the courts, sustaining the forces of the law, and ensuring justice is done. In the wake of the Last War, nobles continue working to repair the damage to their domains, to reintegrate soldiers into civilian life, to deal with the impact of casualties, and to address the needs of refugees seeking shelter in their lands. But with great power comes great responsibility ... and as such, few landed nobles have time to go on adventures.",
								"It's not impossible to create a player character who is both an adventurer and ruler of their lands; perhaps you have a younger sibling or remarkable steward who's doing all the work in your absence. But it's more likely that as a \"noble\" adventurer, you're just a scion of a powerful family, an heir who doesn't yet hold a significant title. Your blood grants you prestige, but you neither carry the responsibilities of your rank nor have access to the full resources of your domain.",
								"In fifth edition, this status can be reflected by the benefits of the noble background. As a noble, you don't have an army at your beck and call, nor a treasury filled with coffers of coin—after all, you're not the one who does the work of collecting those taxes. What you do have is a handful of proficiencies, your family's signet ring, a set of fine clothes, 25 gp in your pocket ... and a feature called Position of Privilege:",
								"\"Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.\"",
								"This underscores that while the precise duties and powers of nobles vary by nation, the defining practical benefit is {@i respect}. As a player character with this background, you're treated as a peer by aristocrats (even outside your home nation) and generally accommodated by \"common\" folk—though the latter may be due to self-preservation rather than admiration. You're not above the law. You can't get away with murder. But people are inclined to think the best of you, expecting you'll uphold the honor and dignity of your rank.",
								"Within the Five Nations, your rank is recognized even when you hold no actual authority in a region—or when you're in another nation entirely. This is tied to the romantic notion that Galifar may someday be restored; all nobles treat those of other nations with respect, because someday they may all be one kingdom again. Even in Darguun and the Mror Holds, pragmatism ensures your connections will have an impact; though this might simply mean enemies are more inclined to ransom you than kill you.",

In situations like this, you might choose the Retainers feature instead (from the \"{@background Variant Noble (Retainers)|PHB|Variant Feature: Retainers}\" sidebar in the {@i {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}}). Perhaps your estates were lost to the Mourning, but you still have three loyal servants who are sworn to follow you to the bitter end. Or if your influence and retainers are all lost, but people with ties to your family's legacy still look kindly on you, you might choose the background of a displaced noble, presented in this chapter's \"{@background Variant Noble (Displaced)|ChroniclesofEberron|Variant Noble: Displaced}\" sidebar.",

From a story perspective, you were once a noble with land and a title to match, but you don't receive any practical benefits from your lineage.

												"An adventurer could gain a noble title as a reward for service, or in some nations, a soldier could win their title through battle. This might be a substantive title—one that grants land and subjects, which can be passed down to heirs—or simply a courtesy that doesn't carry lands or duties. Being granted a knighthood may not confer the benefits of Position of Privilege, but it also probably won't prevent you from further adventuring. On the other hand, becoming a Lhazaar prince might grant that privilege, but it also complicates your adventuring life significantly!

In the Lhazaar Principalities, a character could lose their title because someone else takes it by force. And countless Cyran nobles lost their holdings in the Mourning, then the Treaty of Thronehold effectively stripped them of their privileges.

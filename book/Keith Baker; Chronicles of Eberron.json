						"As I write these words, it's been almost twenty years since I first began exploring the world of Eberron in my mind. Over these two decades, a part of me has always been thinking about Eberron, considering all the questions the official books never had time and space to answer. What's the history of Dor Maleer? Just how smart are Karrnathi undead? Why so barren, Barren Sea?",
						"In the days before the Dungeon Masters Guild, there was no opportunity to create new Eberron content. I couldn't legally release new lore or mechanics—but I {@i could} answer questions. I started doing just that on my website, {@link Keith-Baker.com|www.keith-baker.com}, and over the years, I've written hundreds of articles. But that quantity is a blessing and a curse; some topics are more generally useful than others, but they're needles in a very large haystack. Beyond those questions and answers, I couldn't give players and Dungeon Masters new tools to work with until the Dungeon Masters Guild opened up Eberron for new creations.",
						"These pages you hold in your hands—or, potentially, these pixels you see on your screen—contain the answers to some of my favorite questions. This book blends practical advice (\"How do I start a new campaign? How do I handle travel?\") and deep lore detailing topics like the Twister of Roots and the gnomes of Lorghalan. In compiling this book, I've revised some of my articles and expanded others; even if you've read everything I've written, you'll find things here you've never seen before. And thanks to the excellent work of Imogen Gingell, we've added further depth and concrete mechanics to many ideas I previously only explored as stories.

Similarly, a DM could read about the traditions of Galifar's nobility before introducing their duke NPC—meanwhile, the player of a noble character might review the same information before meeting that duke.",

Most people— including those devoted to the Silver Flame—don't know the actual origins of the Silver Flame; they recognize couatls as divine servants of the Silver Flame, but not as its creators.

That's all great, but someone has to deal with the ghouls in the graveyard. So the church doesn't teach anything about the Sovereigns, and it doesn't encourage its followers to believe in the Sovereigns or incorporate them into its services—but it doesn't specifically deny the Sovereigns exist or forbid followers from holding both beliefs.",

Beyond all else, the faith is practical: supernatural evil exists, it threatens the world, and good people should work together to fight it. Compared to our own world, the Church of the Silver Flame is more like the Jedi or the Men in Black than any of our religions. The Silver Flame is a real, concrete source of celestial energy that can empower champions to fight evil. Noble souls strengthen the Flame after death, so be virtuous—and if you want to believe in higher beings beyond that, feel free. What's important is to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, and faith in the Flame will help you to do that."

We're days away from the Eleventh Century and you're still shooting people with pointed sticks?\" So in 998 YK, Eberron is nearing the point where a soldier could just as plausibly be a leather-clad, wand-wielding warlock as they could be a fighter in plate with sword and shield—but for now, armies still clash with sword and spear.",
								"With that said, Eberron's central concept is that of a world whose progress is driven by magic, not science. Eberron has trains, yes—but they don't use steam or gears, they're a series of stagecoaches that ride a line of lightning. Eberron is not our world, and while the tools its people use may have names we consider medieval, that doesn't mean they are medieval in form or function.",
								"Heavy armor became obsolete in our world because crossbows and gunpowder weapons could easily penetrate it, and because the protective value of the armor no longer offset its limitations on movement. But in fifth edition, this isn't the case: regardless of whether your attacker is using a sword, heavy crossbow, or firearm, plate armor provides more protection than leather armor, and it's remarkably flexible (though noisy), imposing no penalties on Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) checks and the like. You can choose to attribute these qualities to the limitations of a streamlined rules system—but I prefer to embrace the idea that this isn't medieval armor. Though made of heavy plates and requiring Strength to use it effectively, plate armor needn't be medieval in material or appearance.",
								"The same concept applies to other \"medieval\" things. Orien couriers use special {@item horseshoes of speed}, channeling the power of their dragonmark to give a mount greater speed and durability. So yes, people are riding horses instead of motorcycles, but that Orien courier can tear past you with blue light flashing from their horse's hooves! On rare occasions, you might even see a courier with {@item horseshoes of a zephyr} riding a horse across the surface of a river. Eberron is a magical world; rather than thinking \"they don't have cars, the world is primitive,\" highlight what they've developed instead. Describe a squad of Vadalis hippogriffs passing overhead or a street performer weaving wonders out of illusion; it's not {@i medieval}, it's {@i magical}."

Leather and studded leather can be designed to be stylish and comfortable, and many former soldiers wear a modified form of their service armor.

By contrast, a light crossbow in D&D can fire ten bolts per minute with enough damage to drop a commoner with one shot. So while it's no match for modern automatic weapons, the light crossbow is far from medieval.",

The soldiers of Galifar I used medieval-style crossbows, with more limited range and a slow crank to reload; the superior crossbows used today are the result of centuries of engineering. Similarly, the Dhakaani and the Five Nations use highly effective modern crossbows, but when out in some Lhazaar backwater or fighting the Carrion Tribes, adventurers might encounter inferior weapons. You could represent this simply through how you describe a weapon's aesthetics; or if you want to represent it mechanically, perhaps reloading such a crossbow requires a bonus action, and you can't move and reload on the same turn. An even more limited design could reflect a slow crank mechanism by requiring an action to reload rather than a bonus action, reinforcing that this weapon is inferior to what the adventurers are used to."

												"Consider the line of crossbows produced by House Cannith (see \"{@book Crossbows of the Five Nations|ChroniclesofEberron|7|Crossbows of the Five Nations}\"). Cannith's crossbow barrel interior and quarrels are both engraved with arcane sigils. When the quarrel moves against the barrel, the symbols create an arcane interaction—a formula that adds kinetic energy to the bolt. With this in mind, the only force the bow itself has to provide is the initial push of the bolt down the barrel, a spark that triggers the arcane interaction. It's much easier to reload a Cannith crossbow than a medieval one because Cannith's bow itself is actually weaker; the weapon's power needn't depend on the tension of the bow.",

Thus the Spark hand crossbow has a shorter range, while the Thunderbolt heavy crossbow is the largest and longest weapon. In these crossbows, the \"bow\" is a relatively small component of the weapon. In many ways, these weapons resemble firearms, but their force isn't coming from a chemical reaction, but an arcane one.",
												"When using such a crossbow or other ranged weapon, there's nothing stopping you from describing it propelling its ammunition through the air via an arcane reaction. Just remember this doesn't change a crossbow's game mechanics; it's not a magic weapon, so it doesn't bypass damage resistance or register on the {@spell detect magic} spell. (If you take the existence of a minor enchantment to its logical conclusion, an {@spell antimagic field} spell would theoretically suppress the magical reaction and render the weapon useless in that area—but this 8th-level spell is far beyond the everyday magical effects the people of Khorvaire expect to encounter, so this isn't something crossbow manufacturers are worried about.)"

At the same time, we wanted to highlight the steady rise of industrial power and the shifting balance of power between the dragonmarked houses and the established aristocracy.

Galifar's semi-feudal status quo certainly hasn't remained unchallenged for the last thousand years; though prior books don't discuss much of what happened in that millennium, it had its share of uprisings, social experiments, and other remarkable events. As {@loader Exploring Eberron|collection/Keith Baker%3B Exploring Eberron.json} mentions in the \"Untold History\" section of {@book chapter 1|ExploringEberron|1}, the world's history is full of vast periods that were intentionally left unwritten, letting the DM decide what story to tell.",

In the wake of the Last War, nobles continue working to repair the damage to their domains, to reintegrate soldiers into civilian life, to deal with the impact of casualties, and to address the needs of refugees seeking shelter in their lands.

Your blood grants you prestige, but you neither carry the responsibilities of your rank nor have access to the full resources of your domain.",

								"The culture of the Five Nations blends the united traditions of Galifar with the preserved traditions of each nation. The Last War was fought not for independence from Galifar, but in an attempt to reunite it and determine who would rule the united kingdom. With a few notable exceptions (Thrane's theocracy, the Code of Kaius), the Five Nations intentionally preserved the traditions of Galifar, always hoping that within a few years, their ruler would be the sovereign of the reunited Galifar.",
								"While Galifar was a united kingdom, it wasn't a monolithic culture. Throughout its history, the people of Galifar maintained pride in their individual cultures, thinking of themselves as distinct nationalities even while considering themselves citizens of Galifar. A millennium ago, King Galifar Wynarn I—then king of Karrnath—began his campaign to unite the Five Nations by conquering the neighboring kingdom of Metrol. There, Galifar displaced existing nobles and instituted new systems, drastically transforming (and renaming) it as he made Cyre the heart of his new kingdom of Galifar. The other three nations were ultimately brought into Galifar by diplomacy, not by absolute conquest—though Galifar's clear military superiority was the iron fist that drove these negotiations. Galifar I instituted changes at the highest levels of society, appointing his children as the rulers of each nation; but rather than displacing the existing nobility, he generally married his children into the current ruling families.",
								"Galifar built on the existing feudal structures of the Five Nations, but restructured them so it was clear all power ultimately flowed from the sovereign. Over time, he streamlined systems and added new universal concepts, such as expanding education and instituting the Galifar Code of Justice. Meanwhile, he nationalized and advanced the role of institutions such as the Arcane Congress, the King's Citadel, and Rekkenmark. He instituted a standardized currency—the crown-sovereign-galifar-dragon values still used today—and established the Karrnathi dialect as the Common tongue. So all the nations of Galifar were united by a vital set of shared customs and laws, but they also maintained their own unique traditions and quirks, highlighted in the \"{@book Nations and Nobles Today|ChroniclesofEberron|8|nations and nobles today}\" section.",

Galifar I believed he was guided by Aureon and fulfilling a destiny laid out by that Sovereign; given the king's remarkable successes, it's entirely possible he was a paladin of the Host, possibly even a subtle aasimar. The belief that the Wynarn bloodline is blessed by Aureon is a vital cornerstone of the Galifar monarchy. This bedrock principle has stood against uprisings, would-be usurpers, and consorts seeking to claim the crown. In the present day, this belief doesn't come up often and modern monarchs vary in their piety, but it still underlies the traditions of Galifar. The Galifar Code of Justice invokes Aureon, and other aspects of law similarly assume a casual faith in the Sovereigns.",
										"While the faith of the Sovereign Host permeates the Five Nations, it has never been an institution wielding monolithic power like the Church of the Silver Flame does in Thrane. But just as nobles are required to maintain courts, collect taxes, and levy troops within their domains, they're required to sustain the Vassal faith. Depending on the size of a community, this could involve maintaining a grand temple, a small temple with a single priest, or just a small shrine. Most nobles of Galifar viewed this not as a hardship, but an opportunity to display piety; they might lavish resources on their favored temples, raise monuments or shrines to a particular Sovereign, or compete to lure the most accomplished scholars to their seminaries. Within the Sovereign faith, anyone seen as guided by the Nine can fill the role of priest, so some renowned nobles have even acted as priests of the Sovereign Host.",
										"Throughout the untold history of Galifar, some zealous nobles sought to stamp out divergent sects—hunting down and publicly executing followers of the Dark Six (real or imagined) or persecuting \"heretics.\" However, despite his deep faith, Galifar never sought to force his beliefs on others. His kingdom's principles presumed simple faith in the Sovereigns and nobles were required to support the faith—but they and their people weren't required to actually practice it. Following his legacy, the Five Nations are largely tolerant to this day (and many of its monarchs aren't particularly devout), but the principle of Aureon's Blessing remains at the heart of the myth of Galifar."

Nobles governed lands tended by tenant farmers in exchange for collecting taxes and providing military service to the leader of the nation. In many nations, the nobility was also responsible for the administration of justice. Galifar was built on this framework. All power and authority flowed from the sovereign, through the princes and princesses who governed the land, down to local nobles and administrators. Throughout the united kingdom of Galifar, the nobility remained its foundation. They were still responsible for maintaining their territory, including collecting taxes and raising levies for military and national service.",
										"Under the Galifar Code of Justice, nobles didn't administer justice personally, but it was their duty to maintain the system, which included appointing justices and managing the local courts. As the kingdom expanded and life became increasingly more complicated, this produced a class of dedicated civil servants and landowners—initially ennobled viscounts and crown reeves, but ultimately expanding into gentry and merchant classes. But at the start of the Last War, most lands were still associated with a noble's domain, and the local lord still appointed justices, mayors, and other officials. A crown reeve was responsible to their count, the count to their duke, the duke to their prince, and the prince to their king.",

These are a great option for a DM to award to player characters, allowing them to enjoy the status of being a count or shield of the realm without having to give up adventuring and begin maintaining roads and collecting taxes.

While conscription was practiced in the kingdom's early days (a task often delegated to the counts of a duchy), in time, it became common practice for nobles in peaceful regions to pay for Karrnathi troops to enlist in their name.

												"Under the traditions of Galifar, a hereditary title passes to the oldest child of that noble. If there is no living heir, the title passes to the noble's siblings or the siblings' heirs; failing that, the noble who oversees the deceased's domain has the power to reassign it, though that appointment must be ratified by the sovereign. Several noble lines were lost in the Last War (or convicted of treason and stripped of rank), so there are dukes with counties to dispense and counts in need of qualified crown reeves.",
												"In most of the Five Nations, marriage doesn't convey title (other than the prewar practice of elevating the ruler of a duchy to archduke or archduchess when they married a prince or princess). This stems from the principle that only a Wynarn can rule; when the Wynarn monarch dies, their consort has no claim to the throne. Often, a noble consort is granted a courtesy title, as seen with Queen Etrigani of Karrnath; but if Kaius III were to die, the crown of Karrnath would immediately pass to his eldest heir, not to Etrigani. This principle generally holds throughout the ranks. Someone who marries into a noble family is a consort. They may be granted a courtesy title (see \"{@book Honors and Offices|ChroniclesofEberron|8|Honors and Offices}\"), but they're not the equal of their noble spouse—and if they're a player character, it's up to the DM to decide whether their status is sufficient to justify a Position of Privilege. This largely depends on public perception: do the nobles and common folk respect the consort ?",
												"While many nobles limit themselves to a single consort, this isn't enforced by law. A monarch could have multiple consorts, and any child with an official consort (whether by marriage or simple royal decree) is considered an heir. For hundreds of years, it was accepted tradition for a reigning sovereign to have a consort from each of the Five Nations, in part to spread out the burden of producing five heirs. In the wake of the Last War, some nobles have continued this tradition. For example, Kaius III of Karrnath maintains a harem; only Etrigani carries the formal title of queen, but it's possible Kaius has named other partners as consorts. By contrast, Queen Aurala of Aundair has a single consort, but hasn't granted him the title of king.",
												"In most nations of Khorvaire, only the sovereign can create a new title. However, many domains have a set of existing courtesy titles (see \"{@book Honors and Offices|ChroniclesofEberron|8|Honors and Offices}\") that can be dispensed at the discretion of the local noble. For example, the Count of Threeshadows may have the authority to appoint a Viscount Threeshadows and two knights—but these titles aren't passed on to heirs.",
												"In most nations, it's illegal for anyone to sell a title, whether it's their own or a domain within their jurisdiction; Breland is a notable exception to this rule."

										"In addition to the noble titles above, the Five Nations use many other titles that are honors or offices. Similar to the courtesy titles of nobility, these titles signify status but aren't hereditary and don't bestow land.",
										"For example, knighthood (discussed further below) is an honor, not a title of nobility. Traditionally, a duke or higher noble can appoint a knight to reward them for their service to the nation. While there were Karrnathi nobles among the original Order of the Emerald Claw, many knights of the order came from the gentry. On the other hand, among the Karrnathi chivalric orders, the Order of the Inviolate Way only accepts members who are also of noble blood.",
										"Offices include titles like \"Minister of Magic\" or \"Warlord.\" For example, in Aundair, Darro ir'Lain is the Duke of Passage and Second Warlord of the Realm. His title of duke is hereditary, but his second title is an office he currently holds, not something he carries for life. If he fell out of favor with Queen Aurala, there would soon be a new Second Warlord.",

												"By the traditions of Galifar, knights are associated with orders. A knight isn't just a knight; they're a Knight of the Order of the Emerald Claw, or a Knight of the Order of the Inviolate Way. Knightly orders serve three functions. First, a knighthood is an honor reflecting the favor of a sovereign, duke, or lesser noble granted the privilege of appointing knights. Additionally, knightly orders are fraternal orders, and members are expected to support one another in both war and peace. Finally, knightly orders are also elite military units.",
												"Though knights usually serve as elite warriors, that's not always the case; this is similar to how most nobles have substantive titles (with formal responsibilities), whereas others are titled as a courtesy. The Duchess of Karrlakton might appoint one woman as a Knight of the Order of the Blackened Sky because she's an exceptional combat alchemist whose skills will serve Karrnath well on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the duchess might appoint another man to the same order for entirely different reasons: he's an influential citizen of Karrlakton, and she wants both to honor his service and connect him to other members of the order, even though she understands he's not a soldier and will never serve the order on the battlefield.",
												"Sometimes a knighthood comes with an annuity, making it a concrete reward that can help support a non-noble knight. But beyond that, the knighthood's function as a supportive fraternal order comes into play. In the example given above, the combat alchemist may not be a noble nor have significant wealth. Meanwhile, the second knight is wealthy and could serve as a patron to the alchemist. The orders are designed to bring the finest citizens together, people who might normally be split by class lines. Knighthood allows nobles to elevate and forge connections with gifted commoners without actually raising them to the nobility. ({@i Forge of War} presents the most detailed description of knightly orders in canon material, describing six Karrnathi orders on page 54.)"

To date, this has gone unchallenged, in part because it's not entirely clear who would challenge it and in what forum.",
												"Further complicating matters, though dragonmarked heirs have to abandon house ties to marry into noble families, they bring their blood with them—and consequently, there have been nobles who carried dragonmarks. That said, dragonmarks appear most frequently in the dragonmarked houses due to intentional mingling of strong dragonmarked bloodlines. If someone from those bloodlines marries an outsider, a dragonmark is far less likely. As a result, foundling marks are quite rare, and someone who unexpectedly develops a mark may not even realize that they had a connection to a house in their history. So while dragonmarked nobles are possible, they're by no means common."

										"Citizens of the Five Nations are protected by the Code of Galifar. But how does one become a citizen? Keeping in mind that Galifar is based on feudal principles, most nations still require would-be citizens to attend an audience with a local noble. There, the applicant swears fealty to the nation, its ruler, and that local noble; in turn, the noble formally accepts them as a subject. In doing so, the noble accepts responsibility for that individual, and the individual promises to obey that noble, pay taxes, answer any call for conscription, and respect the laws of the land.",
										"Nobles don't have to accept an offer of fealty, and most won't unless the potential subject intends to reside within their domain. For example, a Brelish noble might refuse to accept the fealty of an ogre from Droaam—perhaps because they don't believe the ogre will uphold the laws, or because they don't believe the ogre intends to remain within their domain. And without an accepted oath of fealty, you have none of the privileges of a citizen. Long before the people of the Barrens established Droaam, Galifar I declared the land to be part of Breland's domain—but the region's monstrous inhabitants had never sworn fealty to any Brelish lord. As a result, they weren't considered citizens, and from Galifar's perspective, they were outlaws squatting in Brelish land.",
										"In the modern age, much of the citizenship process is streamlined and standardized by bureaucracy, especially when granting citizenship to children of existing citizens. In some regions, there are annual ceremonies where each youth swears an oath to the local lord before being recognized as an adult. In a populous region like Sharn, the parents file paperwork when the child is born, and when the child becomes an adult, they file their own statement. But the underlying principle remains the same: {@i someone} needs to make a decision on behalf of the local lord as to whether to accept the offer of fealty, based on the applicant's residence, reputation, family, and other factors."

Breland was an active frontier, and its people were more concerned with practical protection than with who was doing the protecting. When Galifar was formed, the lands west of the Dagger were still home to ogres and gnolls, while goblins and gnomes held the lands to the east. Zilargo's grand duchies were quickly incorporated into the united kingdom, but it took centuries for Breland to achieve its current borders.

										"Even before becoming Thrane under Galifar I, the city-state of Daskara was devoted to worship of the Sovereign Host, reflecting the influence of ancient Pyrine (and to a lesser extent, Irian). Just as Karrnath has powerful manifest zones tied to Mabar, Daskara has a few noteworthy zones tied to Irian, which inspire hope and encourage faith; notably, one of these zones is in the region where Flamekeep now stands. Like Galifar I's belief in the Wynarn family's right to rule, the people of Daskara believed their own rulers were blessed by the Sovereigns and governed with divine right. This faith was shaken by their defeats at the hands of Galifar's forces, but he was able to convince most that his united kingdom was part of the divine plan, that their blessed lords were meant to kneel to the Wynarn monarch. Galifar further strengthened this by establishing Daskara as the seat of the Grand Temple of the Host, the greatest temple in the lands. However, divine will was called into question when the dragon Sarmondelaryx ravaged the newly christened Thrane, killing its prince and burning the Grand Temple.",
										"These challenges strained the faith of the Thranes, but it took the overlord Bel Shalor to shatter it. Neither a prince nor the Sovereigns saved the nation from his terror, but a warrior of lowly birth, strengthened by courage and the power of the Silver Flame. In the years and centuries that followed, the people of Thrane largely abandoned the Sovereign Host and embraced the Silver Flame. Bel Shalor's forces had destroyed the Grand Temple of the Host, and the people chose to replace it with the citadel of Flamekeep. This moved the seat of the Vassal faith out of Thrane and to the Cathedral of the Sovereign Host in Metrol.",
										"These changes left the nobles of Thrane in an odd position. They had long touted their supposed divine blessing, but now their people were shifting away from the faith that supported it. Many nobles responded to this by embracing the Silver Flame, sharing the faith of the people, and acknowledging the power that saved their nation. Others sought to balance both traditions; after all, even if the Grand Temple was never rebuilt, the faith of the Silver Flame didn't actually deny the possibility the Sovereigns might exist and might have blessed the noble lines. And a few nobles clung bitterly to the old ways, refusing to acknowledge the new faith and struggling to limit the power of its church within their domains.",

The lands once held through the crown were now considered the property of the church, and the church claimed authority over most civil and military matters previously administered by nobles. The roles of viscounts and blood regents were dissolved and taken over by church functionaries. Higher nobles were allowed to retain a single manor and estate, but no more.",
												"Many nobles chose to work with the church, helping with the transition and earning a place within the theocracy through faith and service. Others were willing to remain in a decorative ceremonial role—a position Queen Diani ir'Wynarn finds herself in today. In theory, she is the Blood Regent and serves as advisor to the Keeper and the Cardinals. In practice, she is largely ignored. While she smiles at the services she attends, Diani believes that Aureon and Dol Arrah have plans for her, and there are loyalists—known as Throneholders— who dream of restoring Thrane's monarchy to its rightful place."

Beyond your retainers, your family still has an estate you can return to, but they have little influence or resources to spare. As a noble of Thrane, are you devoted to the Silver Flame, supporting the nation's new direction? Or are you a bitter Throneholder determined to restore the old order? For a more dramatic twist, you might believe you were chosen by one or more of the Sovereigns for some divine purpose; is this purpose the restoration of the nobility, or do the Sovereigns have a plan for you that doesn't place you at odds with the church?"

										"How does the Code of Galifar handle succession and inheritance when a noble dies... and then comes back? {@i Sharn: City of Towers} establishes that the Code of Galifar doesn't consider undead to be citizens, and undead nobles can't hold property. However, in a world with the {@spell revivify} spell, it's extreme to say that if someone is dead for less than a minute, they lose all their privileges. With this in mind, the common practice in the Five Nations is to observe a two-week grace period while the soul of the dead person is passing through Dolurrh. During these two weeks, they aren't legally dead. A dead noble's heir may immediately take up office to ensure the system keeps running, but a noble raised from the dead during that time retains all their rights and privileges.",
										"On the other hand, after a person has been dead for two weeks, they're legally dead, and the laws regarding inheritance and succession come into effect. A noble returned to life after this period is considered to be a new person with no claim to their old titles or property.

The former duke thus became the first king of New Galifar, despite not being tied to the Wynarn bloodline. The few counts who had supported his cause were named dukes, and wealthy donors who had funded the expedition became counts.",

Most Q'barran nobles are \"claim lords\"— they've been granted titles and parcels of land by the King of Q'barra, but they haven't actually claimed or cultivated those lands. Adderport and Newthrone together have a kingdom's worth of dukes and counts, but most only rule over a handful of retainers and a small city estate.",

However, this was largely a show for the rest of the world; the Valenar have never cared about holding land or titles, as the ancestors they emulate didn't rule petty fiefdoms.

The region was governed by triumvirate with a representative from each duchy. While ostensibly part of Breland, their status as grand duchies allowed them to largely remain autonomous. However, \"grand duke\" is a symbolic role that the Zil largely ignore, except during special interactions with nobles of Galifar.

In practicality, the Triumvirate, the Councils of Nine, and the Trust actually maintain the nation.",

In some accounts, Cyre ir'Wynarn was Galifar's oldest daughter, mere minutes ahead of her twin sister Aundair. In others, Cyre is described as Galifar's youngest son, who ruled as king after his father stepped down. Both accounts are true; as Princess Cyre, her vision of unity shaped her father's kingdom, and as King Cyre, he ascended to his throne.",
										"Galifar's twins, Aundair and Cyre, were the most mystically gifted of the Wynarns. Aundair specialized in evocation and conjuration; she negotiated with celestials and fiends, and brought down her enemies with storm and fire. Cyre was devoted to divination, illusion, and transmutation; their interest was always in understanding the true nature of a thing and exploring the ways it could be expressed. Where Aundair was bold and often reckless, Cyre was thoughtful and empathetic. The Cyran national motto is \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create\"—and this was Cyre ir'Wynarn's motto long before it was the nation's. They sought to understand the people of the Five Nations, and it was Cyre's vision of all five working together—of harnessing the best in all of them—that drove both the development of the nation and the foundation of the united kingdom of Galifar.",
										"Cyre's mastery of transmutation was unprecedented in the Five Nations. Their greatest creation was {@i Cyre's Mantle}, which used principles of transmutation and divination both to alter the form of the wearer and imbue them with new knowledge. Cyre didn't use the mantle as a disguise, but to create unique personas reflecting different aspects of their identity. Their subjects grew used to the \"Five Faces of Cyre,\" and Cyre considered each face to be as much their true nature as the one they were born with. Few who knew Cyre were surprised they chose to rule as King Cyre; this face's confident, decisive persona embodied his strongest leadership qualities. After his coronation, King Cyre used the mantle less often; he wanted the people to have a clear and consistent image of him as king, and only used other personas in private or with close advisors.",
										"Those who are familiar with changeling cultures may recognize elements of traveler philosophy in Cyre's use of personas. While the truth is buried beneath centuries, some tales relate Cyre's great respect for the Children of Jes as he helped them establish havens across the united kingdom. In some of these tales, Cyre didn't actually create {@i Cyre's Mantle}, but received it as a gift from the Traveler. Whatever the truth, both {@i Cyre's Mantle} and some of his advisors disappeared after the king's natural death; various legends tell of the mantle being used at various points in history, but its current location remains a mystery."

Their abilities could result from the curse of an archfey or exposure to a manifest zone's energies. Similarly, an owlin could've once been the owl familiar of an archmage teaching at Arcanix; when this wizard died, their last act was to give their faithful familiar independence and a humanoid form. In these examples, the player gets the abilities they want without the DM adding a new culture to the setting. This approach gives the opportunity to explore the character's relationship with their creator: Why did Mordain the Fleshweaver create a tabaxi? Was the character once his feline familiar? Did the character escape from Mordain, or were they released into the wild, and do they know why?"

Perhaps an entire village was caught in the Mourning and all its inhabitants transformed into tabaxi. Maybe House Vadalis magebred a unit of goliath supersoldiers during the war; the character escaped, but most of their kin are still held in a secret Vadalis facility. Or it's possible there are only a dozen kenku—they were servants of the archfey known as the {@creature The Forgotten Prince|ExploringEberron|Forgotten Prince}, and as punishment for a crime, he stole each kenku's voice and exiled them all to Eberron.",

The Lhazaar Principalities can work for this as well—if no one's ever met the Cloudreavers in your campaign, you can declare that they're goliaths (and always have been). They're rare enough that people don't know them in the Five Nations, and they didn't have a huge impact on the Last War, but they have an island, they have ships, and they're known across the Principalities.

Fey centaurs are neither limited to being half-horse nor half-human, and different tribes can vary drastically. For example, in the Eldeen Reaches, one tribe of centaurs is half-human, halfhorse—but another is half-deer, half-elf. If you look long enough, you might even find a tribe that's half-gnome, half-wolf! These cosmetic details don't affect their statistics, and aren't limited by genetics; while each tribe tends toward a common form, variations aren't unheard of, so the child of an elf-stag centaur could be a gnome-wolf.",

Over the last century, some have chosen to work with the Wardens of the Wood, and centaur cavalry supported the Eldeen secession. However, others prefer to remain in the deep woods and the Twilight Demesne, ignoring the violence and brutality of the world beyond the woods.",
												"Whichever path you take, as a centaur character, your ancestry is unusual but not unheard of. Why have you left your herd behind and chosen to walk on the hard roads of the two-footed? You could be associated with one of the druidic sects, carrying out a mission for the Wardens of the Wood or dealing with threats to Eldeen independence. Or you could just be driven by curiosity; as a centaur bard, you could be chasing a song you can't quite hear, but you know it's out there somewhere."

From that point forward it is the sacred duty of the child to become the living avatar of the fallen champion, mastering his or her skills and living by her code. The people of the Five Nations know little about the Tairnadal, and their general assumptions often don't make sense. Ask ten people in Sharn, and you'll hear that the Valenar are bloodthirsty brutes who love to pillage the weak; that they seek glory in battle and won't fight a weaker foe; that they are bound by a strict code of honor; that they have no honor; that every Valenar is bound to a horse; and so on. In fact, no one rule applies to every Tairnadal, for every ancestor demands a different role of his or her descendants. A child chosen by Maelian Steelweaver will spend his or her days forging swords instead of wielding them. One chosen by Silence will spend life in the shadows. War is the common thread that unites the Tairnadal, because the wars against giants, dragons, and goblins were what produced these legendary heroes. As such, the Tairnadal seek conflicts that will let them face the same odds and fight in the same style as their ancestors. Nowadays a child of Vadallia can't fight giants, because the Cul'sir Dominion has fallen, but they must search for a foe that is equally challenging and then defeat it in the same way Vadallia would, thus creating new legends in Vadallia's name."

Before that, Tairnadal spend decades of their lives training in basic skills, studying Tairnadal history, and maintaining their community, including caring for younger elves. Through this process, each elf is effectively auditioning to the patron ancestors. The young elf who excels at hunting expects to be chosen by a legendary archer or stalker, while the elf who becomes a community leader hopes to be chosen by one of the great leaders of the past.",

Other zaelantar include former zaeltairn who are unable to fight due to age or infirmity, but who can teach the young. The Keepers of the Past are largely zaelantar, serving to train and guide. And finally, the zaelantar include adults chosen by patron ancestors whose legendary skills are tied to the civic sphere: fabled smiths, legendary teachers, the Siyal Marrain (druids who tend the beasts), and so on."

These assignments and duties aren't temporary; once assigned to an army, Tairnadal serve until they die or until they retire (or are forced to retire) to train the young. A Tairnadal army effectively functions as a nomadic city-state; most patron ancestors were guerrilla soldiers and mobility was vital, thus most Tairnadal armies are nomadic, following migratory paths across the steppes. A few armies remain settled, however, based on the specialties of the ancestors represented by the army. Notably, each of the great jungles of the region—around Shae Thoridor and Var-Shalas—is home to an army, whose members specialize in jungle warfare and commando operations."

Were the refugees truly helpless civilians, or had they already been corrupted by the Mourning into a horde of mutated ghouls? Or could the Valenar have been struck by a form of the infamous Du'rashka Tul curse of Xen'drik, driving them into a murderous frenzy?

So if you meet a gnome sage in Aundair named Talia Lorridan Lyrris, you know she considers herself Zil (she's \"Talia of the Lorridan family in House Lyrris\"); on the other hand, if she simply goes by Talia Lorridan, she's likely Aundairian."

Tolanen was established in the Shadow Marches; some years after its founding, a trading vessel docked to find the town completely depopulated. While the travelers blamed pillaging orcs, accounts later confirmed there were no signs of conflict, and the only looting was committed by the merchants themselves. New Zolanberg was constructed on the coast of Xen'drik, near the modern settlement of Zantashk, and it prospered and grew for decades ... and then, within the span of a week, its people tore the town and each other to pieces—a notable example of the curse that's come to be called the Du'rashka Tul. There were a handful of other settlements, but only one still thrives to this day: the principality of Lorghalan."

To the island's west, the Tempest Strait is lashed by storms as powerful as any found in the Thunder Sea. To the southwest, Dreadwood Isle lies close to Mabar and Dolurrh, and strange ghosts and hungry shadows lurk in the depths of its Dreadwood. Lorghalan's northern coastline is lined with hidden reefs and unusual stone outcroppings, and even the most careful of captains can find their ship unexpectedly dashed against the rocks—thanks to the many water elementals that dwell along the coast.",

It never ventures far from its mapped position, but it has no love of ships; any vessel that draws too close may be shattered by a hurled stone or a mighty fist. Though it's possible airships might reach the island safely, they've only been in operation for about a decade—and airships rely on docking towers that the gnomes, quite happy with their fleet, have proven uninterested in constructing.",

Apart from the wild zones of Sarlona, Lorghalan has the most intense concentration of elementals found anywhere on Eberron. Stones roll of their own accord. The earth intermittently rumbles. What seems to be a peaceful pond might unexpectedly move to a new location. Most elementals on Lorghalan are spirits of earth and water, but some are storms that follow paths of their own choosing or pits of endless fire. These elementals are creatures of Lamannia, pure and inhuman; there are no dao or marids here. The deep jungle is home to megafauna beasts, and off the coast of Lorghalan, sailors occasionally spot rocs hunting whales."

But the prince has no power beyond that, and any Lorghali can claim the title by defeating the current prince in a series of duels of wit and strategy. Sometimes decades go by with no challenges; other times, challenges are a weekly or daily occurrence. The young Prince Shasi Stormlyn recently claimed the title, and she's been urging a dramatic course of action, but the DM must decide just what this is: does Shasi want to work more closely with Rygar to establish a powerful, united Lhazaar?

										"The Lorghali produce excellent mediators, apothecaries, and farmers, but what makes them truly remarkable is their tradition of stonesinging—a form of primal magic—and their relationship with the elementals of the region. Lamannian elementals are alien creatures whose thought processes and perception of reality are quite different from the humanoids of Eberron. Rather than binding elementals, as is common throughout Khorvaire, Lorghalan stonesingers influence elementals and natural forces by communing directly with each spirit and convincing it to help. A simple stonesinging effect, such as one produced by {@spell druidcraft}, is hardly more complicated than singing a few words in Primordial. More significant requests require deeper communion with the spirits, including both concentration and an expenditure of will in addition to the song—{@i urging} the spirit to comply and impressing the request onto it. (As such, stonesinging follows the same rules as other forms of spellcasting.)",
										"A stonesinger's most frequent and important work is with elementals. On a Lorghalan ship, a stonesinger literally sings to the elemental associated with the ship, encouraging it to move the vessel swiftly. If a ship's stonesingers are killed, the elemental still recognizes the vessel as friendly, but it can't be compelled to perform any particular action and may simply wander off. On the island, stonesingers negotiate with elementals to establish which territories the gnomes can build within, as well as convincing earth elementals to plow their fields and water elementals to irrigate the crops. Especially remarkable stonesingers can manipulate elemental and natural forces in more subtle ways—charming beasts, encouraging plants to grow, even conjuring fire or calling lightning from a clear sky. Others learn the melodies that define their own bodies, learning how to heal injuries or even change their shape.",
										"Almost every Lorghali knows at least a few simple songs, but those who can work greater magics—usually those with the powers of bards or druids (see \"{@book Variant Rules|ChroniclesofEberron|11|Variant Rules}\")—are greatly respected. While stonesinging is a unique tradition that plays a central role in Lorghalan culture, the gnomes have nothing against other forms of magic; in particular, Lorghalan alchemists perform many wonders using the unusual plants of their island. The original immigrant families included a handful of dissidents from House Sivis, and while the Lorghali have made no particular effort to cultivate the Mark of Scribing, a few gnomes in each generation still manifest the mark; such gnomes often become the most gifted wizards of the island."

The gnomes interact with exceptionally powerful entities, including elementals like the Hammer and legendary megafauna beasts.

They have a very relaxed attitude toward death and the afterlife, focused instead on living their best life; when it's over, it's over, and whatever happens next will happen.

Most Lorghali strive to remain true to the principles of their culture even in hostile lands, solving problems through open discussion rather than treachery and subterfuge. But they aren't fools; a Lorghalan gnome won't spill every secret to a stranger, and if they don't want to lie, they don't have to say anything at all.

The islanders are especially suspicious of their cousins and do not trust the Trust, but they've cautiously engaged in cultural exchange; notably, Lorghalan stonesinging techniques fascinate some Zil, leading to the rise of the Power of Purity movement in Zilargo."

None of the lords of the court challenged him—some remained silent out of fear, but most found they preferred to live in moonlight. And so the Moon Court found its name. But a gnome who loved to dance under the sun sought a respite from the somber shadows. She went to the prince's palace of frozen tears, but found the doors frozen shut. The clever gnome sang a happy song, and as the notes rose to the sky, she caught them, carrying her to the highest tower. When the prince's servants barred her path, the gnome danced with them and melted their frozen hearts. She found the prince on his glittering throne and begged him to return the sun. In response, the prince challenged the gnome to dance for him, to maintain her high spirits while he spoke of every tragedy of the past and of those yet to come. The prince was certain her heart would freeze as his had, but the gnome held fast to her hope and her light.

Even in the most trying times, Shan Pyrial can find a path to the light.",

Its people welcome guests, but visitors carrying greed, cruelty, or evil intent in their hearts can't pass through the Gate of Joy. This is a trait of the gates themselves, not something its guards can control; generally, the gnomes at the gates talk with those who can't enter, trying to learn what burdens them and help them to find a path to joy. Once within the spire, strangers are celebrated. The people of Pylas Pyrial are always curious to learn more about the Sunlit World (their name for Eberron, in contrast to the Moonlit Vale where the spire spends most of its days). Visitors are encouraged to tell stories or display whatever talents they might possess, and entertainers find an enthusiastic audience. Each day ends with a glorious {@spell heroes' feast}.",

The Pyrials call this the Summer Sun, saying the prince plucked it from the sky in Thelanis.",

Seeking things that bring joy, they may be willing to trade a magic item for a fantastic joke or an heirloom that has brought delight to many despite having little monetary value. The gnomes may also trade things in exchange for promises—a promise to spread joy or to help those dwelling in darkness. But visitors should bear in mind that Pylas Pyrial is on the edge of Thelanis, and l promises made here carry great weight. While the spire can be a source of wonderful magic items, the creations of Pylas Pyrial can't easily be replicated in the Sunlit World of Eberron; Zil artificers have long tried to reverse engineer these gifts, but the magic woven into them is tied to Thelanis and defies all logical arcane science.",

Arawai guides those who harvest, while Balinor guides those who hunt, both reflecting our power to impose our will on nature. Through this lens, the Devourer reflects that we can't ever fully control nature and its disasters and tragedies. It's the Devourer who sinks ships and levels villages with wildfires and hurricanes. It's the Devourer who guides the wolves who prey on our sheep.",
										"Under the Pyrinean Creed, there is no benevolent aspect to the Devourer. The Devourer, Arawai, and Balinor are differentiated by the outcome, not by the tool that produces that outcome. It's common for Vassals to associate Arawai with gentle rains and the Devourer with scouring storms—but if overabundant gentle rains cause devastating floods, they're a tool of the Devourer, and if a region relies on monsoons to irrigate land, Vassals see those nurturing storms as gifts of Arawai. A shepherd curses predatory wolves as teeth of the Devourer, but they might well guard their flock using a magebred wolf domesticated by House Vadalis; whether a wolf is associated with Balinor or the Devourer depends on the outcome of interacting with it.",
										"Though this view attributes nothing benevolent to the Devourer, he's still part of everyday Vassal life and faith. The farmer who thanks Arawai for her guidance equally fears the Devourer's wrath, and Vassals who regularly deal with dangerous natural forces often make placatory offerings to the Devourer. A common Vassal saying is that \"the Devourer will have his due.\" If you benefit from the natural world, the Devourer eventually comes to even the scales—but if you make an offer willingly, he may accept it and pass you by. Vassals typically burn a fraction of the yield after a harvest; skeptics simply burn the dross, while the devout base the burn on their own prosperity and what they have to lose. Vassal sailors trust Kol Korran to guide them, but many also cultivate a relationship with the Devourer and make an offering when their vessel reaches deep water. This offering could be anything from a single crown to a lock of hair, a poem, or something more precious; it depends on the perceived danger of the voyage and where they feel they stand with the Lord of the Depths. Again, there is no thought of benevolence here. Many sailors essentially view it as playing poker with a deadly opponent—how well do you know your enemy and what can you get away with on this voyage? Though this superstition is common, some captains won't abide it on their ships; they may assert it's a foolish waste of resources, or simply believe that making offerings to the Devourer is more likely to draw his attention than placate him.",

When such a Storm Herald comes to a community, they call together the Vassals and have them organize a communal feast. At this feast, the Herald calls on people to discuss their profit and loss, the blessings they've received from the Sovereigns, and what is owed to the Devourer. Sacrifices are made both through the feast itself and through additional burnt offerings at the feast. In so doing, the community hopes the Storm Herald helps them buy a period of prosperity, carrying disaster away when the herald leaves. Storm Heralds are extremely rare, mainly known through stories. Some of these tales depict them as good people who are truly trying to help innocents avoid disaster, while others tell of extortionists running supernatural protection rackets—\"unless I'm satisfied, there {@i will} be a disaster.\""

A typical zealot becomes infuriated by a particular manifestation of civilization—a new Tharashk mine, a Vadalis ranch, a lightning rail line driving across their field, or even just local farmers cutting down a tranquil grove—and their intense devotion to their target's destruction unlocks divine power. Devourer zealots generally have more in common with cults of the Dragon Below than with druidic sects; if they band together with fellow zealots or accumulate followers, such a sect typically lacks organization or deep tradition. Should a zealot achieve their goal, they might snap out of that obsession and return to normal life... or they might latch onto a new and even greater obsession—having destroyed the Orien ranch near their village, they're now determined to destroy the house enclave in the nearby city, continually escalating until they finally fall in battle. While zealots can be tied to the Three Faces of the Wild, they're characterized by their ever-growing obsession with destroying their target and the degree of supernatural power they wield; a Three Faces sect might try to negotiate with an environmental offender or to otherwise find a peaceful solution, while a zealot sees themself as the vengeful hand of the wild."

												"Champions of the Devourer can take many forms. One zealot might have the gift of wild shape and run with a pack of wolves—drawing on the Moon druid for inspiration—while another might be more like a Storm sorcerer, wielding {@spell shocking grasp} and {@spell lightning bolt|PHB|lightning bolts}. But what's the difference between a druid, cleric, or paladin of the Devourer, versus one devoted to Arawai (or Balinor)?",
												"Remember that the Devourer isn't the Sovereign of Storms; he's the Sovereign of the destructive power of nature, while Arawai is nature harnessed in the service of civilization. As such, their followers could wield very similar divine magic, but with a different {@i feeling} and to a different end. For example, a servant of Arawai could smite an enemy with lightning or unleash a tidal wave, but for them, this is no different from the ability to plant a seed or to harness an ox to a plow; they've been granted dominion over nature as a tool to serve the greater good. Such a character is typically calm—even serene—when using their powers, and they strive to minimize collateral damage. On the other hand, the champion of the Devourer teaches us that nature cannot be controlled. They revel in the wild and primal nature of the powers that flow through them and make no effort to avoid collateral damage; after all, they were granted these powers to make people fear the power of nature.",
												"So even if two clerics are casting the exact same spell, it should feel different depending on whether it's tied to Arawai or to the Devourer. Arawai's {@spell lightning bolt} is focused and precise, while the Devourer's is wild and intimidating, as if the caster is barely in control of the bolt. Keep in mind that the spells wielded by player characters don't have to reflect the absolute limits of mystical power. It's possible that an NPC Storm Herald can curse a community with a promise of a devastating hurricane—and follow through on the threat. Similarly, the death of a champion of the Devourer might trigger a devastating flash flood. Neither of these effects have the precision or speed of {@spell control weather} or {@spell tidal wave}... but that very unpredictability is what makes them interesting. If a DM and player agree, it's possible that even a player character who's tied to the Devourer could be a lightning rod, drawing disasters wherever they go unless they ensure that the people around them make sufficient sacrifices."

Ghaal'gantii—the Devourer—speaks through the storms that lash the land, through the fangs of the worg, through the stone beneath the hands of the medusa. This isn't a tradition of shepherds; it's the faith of the wolves. There's no need to split the roles of hunter and predator, and no interest in a deity to bless the harvest; outside of the Gaa'ran orcs, widespread agriculture is all but unknown. The Devourer embodies a view of a world that's red in tooth and claw. He is the hunger that drives us to survive, but he places deadly obstacles in our way; those who overcome the challenges of the Devourer grow strong and prosper, while the weak are swept away to make room for the strong.",
										"For most who follow the Cazhaak faith, the Devourer is a force to be endured rather than celebrated. He'll test you with a hurricane or a wildfire, lash you with thorns, and his hand is in the deadly currents of the rapids. You can certainly offer a prayer or a sacrifice, but what he wants is your strength. Survival isn't something he gives in exchange for a paltry offering; he has already given you tooth and claw, and he wants you to use them. Because of this, many peoples of Droaam acknowledge the Devourer, but they rarely invoke him or make offerings as the Vassals do.",
										"The worgs and the lycanthropes of the Great Pack—the purest predators of the region—are a notable exception to this. They call on the Devourer to sharpen their senses and their fangs, not as a petition, but an offer: \"join me in my hunt, that you may share my joy in victory.\" The Cazhaak Devourer has no need of weaklings who require his aid to survive; but a worthy hunter can draw his eye and his favor, and their only sacrifice need be the kill itself. These devotees are often equally devoted to the Fury; the Devourer is a source of physical strength, while the Fury is the source of instinct; both are important to the hunting worg.",
										"Beyond the predators, the Devourer also draws prayers from those who work with natural resources. Large-scale agriculture may be uncommon, but medusa stoneworkers and kobold apothecaries thank the Devourer for nature's bounty. Even here, though, the tone is different from the thanks offered by the Vassal priests of Arawai. The Cazhaak faithful know that the Devourer gives nothing; he only offers you the chance to take it. Essentially, the Devourer puts the \"hunt\" in \"hunter-gatherer.\" Whether you're an apothecary looking for bloodroot or a sculptor seeking the perfect place to strike the stone, you face a challenge; the Devourer will sharpen your eyes and give you the hunger to succeed, but you must still fight for your victory. The people of Droaam don't sail, but if they did, they would scoff at the placatory offerings of Vassal sailors. If the Devourer chooses to challenge you with a storm, he will; you honor him and earn his favor by facing that challenge without fear and surviving it.

Her father the Devourer embodies the devastating power of the storm outside us; the Fury is the storm that rages within us, the wild emotions we fight to control.\"",

Just as there are Three Faces of War, there are Three Faces of Love: Boldrei is the love that binds, Arawai is the love that brings life, and Szorawai—the Fury—is the love that burns.",

For example, if you're driven by a desire for vengeance against Erandis Vol, you might have no idea where Vol is nor possess the personal power to bring her down— in which case, you could devote yourself to fighting the entire Emerald Claw until the path to Vol is made clear. Or if a criminal killed your parents, you could devote yourself to wreaking vengeance on all criminals. If you're driven by the Fury, you don't care about the cost of revenge, and you're not seeking \"fair\" punishment; your quest is raining down pain and suffering on those who wronged you. Will you ever reach the end of that dark path? Or is your need for vengeance an allconsuming flame?"

Much like some Vassals make a sacrifice to the Devourer in the face of an oncoming storm, begging the Devourer to turn his rage to someone else, some do the same for the Fury. They don't expect the storm of emotions to suddenly stop; rather, they hope to burden someone else instead.",

The principle is simple: if you're dealing with an emotion you can't handle, you can make a sacrifice—and if it's accepted, your pain will be given to someone else. This practice is largely reviled because it's a zero-sum game; {@i someone} will suffer your sorrow or despair. But if you're willing to pass your pain to a stranger, it's a possibility. Such an altar can also be used to beg the Fury to ignite a spark of passion in an object of affection; but as always, the love of the Fury is wild and uncontrollable, and such a prayer often leaves ashes in its wake."

Sometimes we don't stop to think about how mechanical moments—landing a critical hit or being the victim of one, receiving Bardic Inspiration or being saved by an ally's reaction—actually feel for the character. Do you feel a moment of rage when you suffer a grievous injury? Is there a moment of doubt or despair? Or are you cold and austere, refusing to let any emotion distract your perfect focus? This doesn't have to come up in every situation; no one wants to discuss their feelings about every roll. But it can be fun to think about whether a character embraces their emotions or suppresses them, whether that could change over the course of a campaign—and whether there's any chance of them losing control.",

A villain could be driven by revenge, giving themself to the Fury and refusing to consider the consequences of their actions until they've achieved their goal. This can be more interesting if the adventurers (or their players) know the villain's rage is justified; they can sympathize with the desire for revenge while still needing to prevent collateral damage or uphold the law. As an interesting twist on this, an ally of the adventurers could become a vengeful hand—complete with divine powers—after suffering a terrible tragedy that the player characters failed to prevent. How will the adventurers stop their friend, knowing the vengeful hand doesn't care about the damage they do in pursuit of revenge?",

When the adventurers arrive in a small village and see a dozen red candles in different windows, it's clear that there's trouble in this town—what will they do about it? Are all these candles tied to a tyrant who's hurting their people, or do the candles reflect a complex web of interwoven feuds, where helping any one of the victims will be seen as taking sides?",

Regardless of your subclass, you likely have the ability to inspire primal emotions as a Reveler, and you encourage people to fully experience and feel their feelings. I like to think of a Fury-tied bard's spells as gifts of devotion as opposed to lore (though this doesn't have a mechanical effect). It's possible you only embrace the Fury fully when in the throes of performance, but you could also play a priest who tries to help people understand their feelings at all times ... or you could even play a priest who fights to bring down any system that seeks to compel or control peoples' thoughts and emotions. This is different, however, from the priest of the Traveler who inspires chaos and change on a societal level; the Fury is more driven by the storm within each heart.",

In the myths of the Sovereign Host, the Sovereigns {@i fight} death, and they're not fighting the Keeper. He's not the Sovereign of Death, he's first and foremost the Sovereign of Greed; however, one of the things he desires most are souls, and he does use death and all the myriad ways of causing it as a way to get the souls that he desires. Wasting sickness, food poisoning, sheer bad luck—the hand of the Keeper can cause death in countless ways, but all are merely a symptom of the Keeper's greed ... and all can potentially be staved off if you placate him with other treasures.",
								"{@loader Exploring Eberron|collection/Keith Baker%3B Exploring Eberron.json} describes the Keeper as \"the patron of those who put personal gain above all else. He guides those who use guile to gain gold, regardless of the cost to others. A rogue who invokes Olladra sees themself as the hero of the story; one who calls on the Keeper has no compunctions about being the villain. Beyond guiding those who place profit before all else, the Keeper is also known for his willingness to make deals— though his bargains are always slanted in his favor. Priests known as Talons make these deals on behalf of the Keeper, though the terms are often abstract and driven purely by faith. An entertainer could bargain with a Talon, exchanging ten years of their life for fame; even if the entertainer subsequently becomes famous, there's no way to know if this is the result of the bargain, nor to anticipate when the entertainer might suddenly die.\"",

If you're lucky, he might just steal your flaunted wealth—or worse, he may desire you, and even the mightiest hero can be laid low by disease or ill fortune. Once the Keeper pulls you down into darkness, he snatches your soul before it can reach Dolurrh and adds you to his endless hoard, where he can toy with and torment you until the end of time.",

The answer is both yes and no. It's an observable fact that souls fade in Dolurrh—but the question is {@i why}. Vassals maintain that as memories fade, this reflects that soul's transition to a higher level of reality; the soul isn't lost, but joins the Sovereigns. If the Keeper steals you, he steals your chance at paradise ... or even if you don't believe that souls join the Sovereigns, you're still choosing between oblivion or eternal torment at the hands of the Keeper. So most people very reasonably prefer to avoid his grasp.",

												"The doctrine of the Restful Watch is based on the idea that most spirits pass through Dolurrh and into the realm of the Sovereigns, but once someone has entered the realm of the Sovereigns, they can never return. As a result, if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, intending to restore that hero when the time is right. Thus, initiates of the Restful Watch present themselves first and foremost as servants of Aureon, but they understand the Keeper and help people avoid his grasp. When preparing a funeral, an initiate of the Watch helps the bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or a sacrifice to distract the Keeper and ensure that the soul reaches Dolurrh. For a simple person with few achievements, a single coin might suffice; but the more remarkable the deceased, the greater interest the Keeper will have, requiring a more significant sacrifice to distract him."

Other times they're targeted by random violence, often muggings or other acts driven by greed.

A swindler who is especially skilled at separating people from their riches may be said to be blessed by the Keeper, just as a skilled blacksmith may be thought to be favored by Onatar; such a scoundrel likely doesn't have the trappings of a priest, but others may still ask for (and pay for) their blessing. On the other hand, a priest of the Keeper could run their own guild of thieves, typically seeing their congregation as a tool to further their own greed. The {@class cleric|PHB|Trickery|Trickery|PHB} domain is excellent for a cleric following this aspect of the Keeper, but this path is just as appropriate for any rogue, criminal, or charlatan."

												"The Keeper is always searching for new treasures to add to his hoard, and these can include souls or memories as well as material goods. A bargain with the Keeper can get you wealth, magic items, the powers of a warlock, or more. While the gifts of the Traveler often have unexpected consequences, the goods of the Keeper are generally exactly what they appear to be... but the Keeper never makes a deal unless the price is in his favor. Whatever you get from the Keeper, you'll have to give up something of even greater value.",
												"How do bargains with the Keeper work? The Six don't walk the world, so you have to find a Talon—an intermediary who can make a bargain on behalf of the Keeper. Anyone who believes they have a strong connection to the Keeper could serve in this priestlike capacity—whether a Keeper's Fang, a priest of the Restful Watch, a Pennyroyal, or even a random grifter convinced their talents are a gift from the Lord of the Hoard. Despite all of these options, mortal Talons are exceptionally rare, and those with established track records are even rarer. A Talon is defined by their string of successes; to attract business, people have to believe they can speak for the Keeper. But the Keeper acts in his own time and in his own way.",
												"As a result, working with a Talon is entirely a matter of faith. The petitioner comes with a request, and the Talon establishes the exact terms. Payment is often abstract: the most common fee is the assurance that the Keeper will claim the petitioner's soul after death, often with an added limitation on maximum lifespan (\"Should you live to be forty years of age, the Keeper will end your life and claim his rightful prize\"). But payment could also be something unique that the petitioner possesses, whether physical or metaphysical. The only constant is that the Kefeper never makes a bargain unless the price is in his favor; the cost is always dear.",
												"If a Talon's bargain has a material cost, they take the goods on behalf of the Keeper, but they don't fulfill the bargain themself, and there's no guarantee as to {@i when} the Keeper will uphold his end of it. So an aspiring merchant could make a deal to acquire wealth and success in exchange for the only picture of her mother and a shortened forty-year lifespan; the Talon takes the picture and the merchant goes on her way. Within the year, the merchant has a run of good fortune, or finds a wealthy investor, or stumbles on buried treasure that allows her to set up her business. Is this the result of the bargain, or just coincidence? Will she die when she's forty, or is that also just superstition? Through the eyes of a skeptic, a Talon's bargain is highly suspect; but few people are skeptical enough to try to cheat a Talon, as being wrong would prove far too costly.",
												"Metaphysically, many believe the Keeper is able to bestow the more abstract gifts on people through imbuing them with an element of one of the souls in his hoard. For example, the Keeper might grant musical talent by imbuing the seeker with the soul of a renowned bard. In some ways, this is similar to channeling a Tairnadal patron ancestor—but Pyrinean priests suggest that it's a horrible experience for the subject soul, which is said to be bound helplessly to the beneficiary, forced to watch as the bargainer uses their knowledge but unable to act or influence the world in any way. Again, there's a reason people aren't encouraged to make these deals! Since the Keeper depends on souls in his hoard to empower many of his bargains, there are limitations to his gifts. He can give material wealth, specific treasures, skills, or knowledge—but he can't offer knowledge no mortal has discovered, nor skill no mortal could possess. This is a critical difference between the Keeper and the Shadow. In exchange for your soul, the Keeper can give you the skills of someone who's died. The Shadow, however, can offer secrets no mortal has ever known—likely at the high cost of using that knowledge to hurt others.",

												"The Three Faces of Coin is a mystery cult devoted to Onatar, Kol Korran, and Kol Turrant (the Keeper). Like all Three Faces cults, it's a secretive and exclusive organization; initiates are recruited because they're considered to be blessed by one of the Three Faces. Members are often successful merchants or captains of industry, and the cult includes members of the Aurum and the dragonmarked houses. However, the Three Faces of Coin has no grand agenda. At its simplest level, the cult is a fraternity for those who understand the mysteries of coin, and it provides valuable opportunities for networking and bargaining.",
												"The Three Faces of Coin govern the \"battlefield\" of commerce and industry, the struggle to get the things that we want. Onatar guides those who create the goods people desire, Kol Korran inspires those who trade in the light, and Kol Turrant guides those who work in the shadows. All members of the cult are driven by the same principles: You should always be able to get the things you desire, but good work always deserves a fair price. All people should have a path to profit, provided they are willing to work for it. An honest blacksmith should always be able to profit from their hard labor, and someone who wishes to purchase the smith's goods should have a way to do so ... even if that requires unscrupulous collaboration.",
												"The blessed of Kol Turrant—known as Pennyroyals— walk a crooked line. The archetypal Pennyroyal is a smuggler or a fence—someone who dodges the laws to get people the things they desire. However, Pennyroyals also include grifters, pickpockets, and thieves. This seems perfectly reasonable to most Coins (the casual term for initiates of the sect), since you should always be able to get the things that you desire—even if you're skirting the whole reason fair prices matter. Of course, the thief always believes they should be paid a fair price for their own services! After all, fellow Coins deserve fair payment most of all, even if a few unlucky bystanders get scammed in the process.",
												"As a follower of the Three Faces of Coin, it's up to you to decide which of the three paths you'll walk. You can choose to only follow the path of Kol Korran and to engage in honest commerce, but you also recognize your comrade's right to step into the shadows when they can't get what they desire in the light. Coins don't inherently oppose trade laws; they simply believe there should always be a way around these laws for those prepared to work for it. The honest merchant may never deal with a Pennyroyal, but they know that they {@i could}.",
												"The dark side of the Three Faces of Coin is reflected by their embracing Kol Turrant. The Coins understand that in the right time and place, greed can be good— and it's better to understand and use it than to run from it. After all, everyone wants things, and everyone who creates wants people to want those things they create. The Coins say that there's nothing wrong with that desire, and there's nothing wrong with bending the rules to get what you want, as long as you're willing to pay a fair price. As such, the Three Faces of Coin is one of the only sects openly willing to sell the spells of its divine spellcasters. Spells are commodities; if you want one, you should pay for it. This doesn't mean a Coin cleric {@i has} to charge their companions for casting helpful spells; but you recognize your magic has value, and you {@i could} charge for it, so if you're choosing to give this as a gift to a friend, they'd better appreciate it!"

These priests generally take the place of the Restful Watch, though they lack the benevolent aspect of Aureon. They still perform funerals and tend cemeteries, but they have no qualms about presenting themselves as servants of the Keeper as opposed to being tied to some greater good. Like the Restful Watch, they set a price for a soul's safe passage; however, this definitely includes personal profit for the priest. In communities served by a Keeper's Hand, it's generally accepted that one can gain the Keeper's favor by sending him choice souls, either by simple dedication (\"Keeper take your soul!\") or fuller ritual ... so if you don't pay the Keeper's Hand to ensure a loved one's passage to Dolurrh, they instead profit by selling the soul to the Keeper themself.",

Especially near city centers and other populous regions, a Keeper's Hand may be involved with smuggling or managing other criminal enterprises in addition to their religious duties. Such a Keeper's Hand can make an excellent greed-driven mercenary adventurer, open to all potentially profitable endeavors.

When Death came with his army of corpses, the eldest brother was nowhere to be seen; he lacked the courage to face this dreadful foe. The mortal soldiers quaked, seeing their fallen comrades now serving in the army of the dead. But the young brother filled the soldiers with courage and inspired them with his strength, scattering the forces of the dead. And the sister called on the light of the sun, blinding Death until her soldiers could safely retreat. Though the battle was lost, the champions were able to save most of their soldiers. They learned that their missing elder brother had used the distraction to steal a great treasure from the Citadel of the Dead, caring more for his personal enrichment than for the lives of his siblings, their soldiers, or his own oath.",
								"This is the story of Dol Azur—the Mockery. It takes many forms across many cultures, and the details are always different. In the Pyrinean version of the story, Aureon orders that the Mockery be stripped of both his name and his skin, his truth laid bare for the world to see. By contrast, the Cazhaak myth tells that the elder brother fools his siblings by shedding his skin and using it as a decoy; going forward, he often strips the skin off his enemies and wears it to fool their friends. The reason for the Mockery's betrayal similarly varies. In the common Pyrinean story, the Mockery betrays his siblings due to cowardice and envy, using the opportunity to enrich himself instead; if he'd bravely stood with his siblings, Death could have been defeated. But the annals of the Three Faces of War instead say that Dol Azur believed the battle to be a fool's errand from the beginning, as it's impossible to defeat Death; rather than fighting an unwinnable battle just because he'd sworn an oath to do so, Dol Azur used the distraction to steal a mighty weapon from the enemy's citadel. So while his action was unquestionably a dishonorable betrayal, he also accomplished a tactically significant objective, rather than fighting an \"honorable\" fight that couldn't be won.Such shifting interpretations are common with the Sovereigns and Six, reflecting the values of the cultures and individuals who worship or revile them. Within Khorvaire, there are three common approaches to the Mockery. The common Vassals blame him for the excesses of war and for cruel betrayal. Some emulate him, seeking to earn his favor through acts of cruelty. And others see him not as the Lord of Betrayal, but as the Sovereign of Victory—a deity who can always show you the way to overcome your enemies, even if it is a dark path.",

If the goblin defeats the ogre, it doesn't matter if they used poison or treachery; they should be celebrated for finding a path to victory. In this harsh, ruthless vision of the world, you should always be ready for betrayal, and always be watching for weakness in others. Though one might think that this philosophy would undermine any form of community, the Cazhaak Creed does create communities—just in a very different way from Boldrei's love and Aureon's laws. A Cazhaak community is a wolf pack, and its leaders must command respect with their cunning and power. You follow your leader because you believe you'll prosper under their rule. So if a leader isn't betrayed, it's not because of their people's honor or duty; it's either because the people think it's in their own self-interest to serve the leader, or because the people believe they couldn't get away with a betrayal."

It's the most widespread and well known of the Three Faces cults; it was deeply rooted in the united army of Galifar, and cult chapters can now be found in all of the armies of the Five Nations. Allegiance to the Three Faces doesn't supersede national loyalty, but shared knowledge of the mysteries of war provides a foundation for friendship between soldiers of different nations and ranks; in the eyes of the Three Faces, all are equals. If a player character with the soldier background chooses to be an initiate of the Three Faces of War, this can help explain how they benefit from their Military Rank feature with soldiers of other nations; even if they fought one another in the Last War, they respect each other as initiates into the mysteries.",
												"Followers of the Three Faces of War believe that honor and courage are always to be valued, but there are times when cunning is the only path to victory. They acknowledge that the world would be a better place if we could all live in Dol Arrah's light—but also that the world is cruel, and there are times when victory must come before honor. They also recognize the power of psychological warfare and that sometimes demoralizing a foe is the best way to avoid bloodshed. Overall, the cult respects Dol Azur as a less intense version of the Lord of Victory. They downplay his role as {@i betrayer} and focus more on {@i cunning} and {@i finding a path to victory}.",
												"Members of the Three Faces often feel they have a particular affinity for one of the Sovereigns; those who feel guided by Dol Azur may still seek to use their powers for good, but acknowledge they have a knack for sowing terror or ruthless action when it becomes necessary. Within the sect, steel is used to represent Dol Dorn, gold to represent Dol Arrah, and leather to represent Dol Azur; if a soldier wears a leather ring, it might be a sign they feel they're guided by the Mockery. On the flip side, even a soldier who accepts that Dol Azur is part of war doesn't have to embrace his path themself; a soldier could decide that they are guided by Dol Arrah and wear gold to show it.",

When you're running a pulp campaign and you want someone who feels capital-E Evil, a Flayed Hand monk fits the bill. Someone who is guided by the Pyrinean Creed but nonetheless embraces the Mockery is someone who delights in cruelty and believes they gain strength by inflicting suffering on others.",

Those who venerate him as the Lord of Victory might band together into a wolf pack, a group that'll do whatever it takes to survive and overcome a foe.",

Those who follow the Cazhaak path genuinely see the idea of honor in war as a childish concept. This doesn't make them evil—just because the world is cruel doesn't mean they have to be unnecessarily cruel, but they'll do whatever is required to survive and only show mercy if they see some clear benefit down the road. On the other hand, rather than highlighting differences, introducing the Three Faces of War can forge a bond between soldiers of all nations.

												"Though honoring the Mockery is an unlikely path for a Vassal player character, it's certainly possible to play the cynical hero who wields fear as a weapon, such as Batman or the Shadow (the pulp hero, not the deity!). This is a dark path to follow, as the fearmonger knows they are inflicting suffering on their enemies; but to them enemies don't deserve to be treated with honor, so it's acceptable to engage in a brutal war on evil, fighting fire with fire. Most likely, a vigilante who embraces the Mockery in this way believes that the law is ineffective— that Aureon's laws and Dol Arrah's honor have failed, and that only cruelty and fear can overcome the threats the character is facing or avenge the wrong that's been done to them. The Dark Petitioner rogue presented at the end of this chapter is one excellent option, but any class could reflect such a vigilante character. On a darker note, a particularly ruthless warlock might believe their power flows from the Mockery—and their Mask of Many Faces invocation might require a strip of skin from the person they wish to impersonate, whether living or dead. The same could apply to a Whispers bard's Mantle of Whispers feature, or to any character who wields fear as a weapon and regularly uses the {@spell disguise self} spell.",
												"Even when playing a more traditional Vassal, keep in mind that Vassals see the hand of the Sovereigns and Six in all walks of life. When anger or despair gets the better of you, that's the Fury taking hold of you for a moment. If you take a cheap shot in a wrestling match— when the crowd goes \"Oooh, that's a dirty trick!\"—then you're listening to the Mockery. Dol Dorn gives you the strength and skill you need to win in a fair fight, while the Mockery can show you how to win even when the fight isn't fair. But throwing one sucker punch doesn't suddenly make you a cultist of the Mockery. Think of it like someone in our world saying \"the devil made me do it.\" The Dark Six are always with us, trying to pull us down sinister paths. Good Vassals should strive to heed Aureon's law and spread Dol Arrah's light, but everyone has moments of weakness.",

To you, displays of kindness and altruism are suspect, and you don't expect people to keep their word if it becomes an inconvenience to them. After all, people are driven by self-interest—so the key to a lasting bargain isn't a word of honor; it's making sure that neither party dares to break the agreement."

She's known as a reliable source of information about the underworld, always willing to share her knowledge ... for a price. But she may also approach the adventurers and simply tell them things. Did they know that Ilya Boromar is going to assassinate Saidan Boromar tonight? Did they know that their recently murdered friend was killed by Thora Tarkanan? Thalanna has nothing personal to gain by sharing this information, but she enjoys setting wheels in motion. And Thalanna can offer to teach a wizard character a few things they won't learn in Arcanix—these secrets are powerful, but is the character willing to pay the price?",
										"Shadow sects can also fill the classic role of the warlock coven or the infernal bargain ... people being granted mystical power in exchange for performing malevolent actions. Often this is about ambition—getting the power you need to fulfill your darkest desires—but it can also be driven by fear. The leader of a warlock coven may play on fears of the Mourning, refugees, or even monsters. Join them and they'll teach you the magic you need to protect yourself! As mentioned in the \"The Shadow and the Overlords\" sidebar, such a cult could have connections to the Lords of Dust, either Sul Khatesh or Bel Shalor.",
										"Another Shadow-driven villain is the wizard who is determined to unlock ultimate arcane power, regardless of cost. Such a character could even have a noble goal; for example, a wizard who believes they must unlock the power of the Mourning so they can prevent it from spreading or being harnessed by one of the Five Nations. Regardless of motives, this character becomes consumed by their ambition and doesn't care who they hurt in pursuit of their goal. Perhaps they need to open a manifest zone to Mabar in the middle of Sharn to complete a ritual or learn a secret—despite knowing this will break Sharn's connection to Syrania and bring down the towers. It doesn't matter, because the knowledge they acquire will help them save the entire world!",
										"To be clear: these examples are extremes. There are some who offer prayers to the Shadow who aren't warlocks or wizards, who don't seek to tempt others or destroy the world. The ultimate principle of the Shadow is that nothing is forbidden, so you shouldn't let laws or the dictates of society hinder your ambition. Do you believe you'd do a better job than your boss, but it's going to take decades to get there if you follow the system? The Shadow tells you the system is the problem.",
										"Additionally, the Shadow embraces those others call \"monsters\"—you needn't be evil to be drawn to it, simply seeking a place to call your own. While the Mockery and the Keeper can be patrons for criminals driven by greed or violence, the Shadow is a patron for anyone who feels they stand apart from Boldrei and Aureon—perhaps they haven't found a place in their community, or feel that the laws only exist to hold them back. In this, there's some overlap with the Traveler; the Traveler encourages people to challenge systems and to drive change, while the Shadow is more about pursuing personal ambition.",

The Traveler wears a different name and face in every tale, but we know they're the Traveler because of the impact of their actions. Sometimes the gifts of the Traveler raise you up, and sometimes they ruin you. The only constants are chaos and change—shattering the foundation of your life and forcing you to find a new path forward.",
								"In the common traditions of the Sovereign Host, the Traveler is presented as a malicious entity who revels in misfortune, chaos, and confusion. Good fortune is the blessing of Olladra, but when something fails at the worst possible moment, it's the hand of the Traveler. In these stories, the Traveler seeks to undermine all security, to tear down every foundation. Any stranger could be the Traveler, seeking to bring you to ruin. By contrast, those who follow the Traveler say that the change the Traveler brings is a positive thing—that chaos spurs innovation and revelation, that it's important to challenge traditions and abandon those that have served their purpose. Like most of the Dark Six, the Traveler focuses on the good of the individual over the stability of institutions: they help you find {@i your} path, rather than being bound by tradition. When you meet a stranger on the road, are you afraid of this possible threat or excited to meet someone new?",
								"In addition to discussing the common Vassal view of the Traveler, this section examines two other relevant sects. The Cazhaak tradition, the common faith of Droaam, respects the chaos of the Traveler as a force that challenges tradition and forces people and civilizations to evolve. Meanwhile, the most devoted followers of the Traveler are the Children of Jes, nomadic changelings who view the Traveler as a personal guide and source of inspiration.

										"The Traveler touches the domains of many other Sovereigns. Like Aureon and the Shadow, the Traveler is a source of knowledge. Along with Olladra and the Mockery, the Traveler is a patron of those who rely on deception and cunning. Like Onatar, they can provide inspiration to the artisan. Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere them agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it's because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you know. If they help you deceive, it's because your actions will introduce chaos and crisis into your life or the lives of others. While Onatar teaches a swordsmith to make a better sword, the Traveler might show her how to make a bomb, changing the face of warfare. The Traveler isn't here to help you to satisfy your greed or to achieve your ambitions—instead, they set you on paths you never thought to try. They may grant you good fortune, but when you call on the Traveler, you invite the unexpected into your life.",
										"The Traveler isn't {@i evil} in the same way as the Devourer or the Shadow. But most Vassals view the Traveler as an entirely malicious force—while those who honor the Traveler emphasize the potentially positive aspects of chaos. Take one common myth as an example: A smith gives Dol Dorn a magic sword, promising that it can defeat any foe. Dol Dorn rashly challenges a band of demons, but as he fights, the blade shatters. Refusing to retreat, Dol Dorn fights on and brings down his enemies with his fists and feet ... creating the martial art practiced by the Vassal monks of the Order of the Broken Blade. The typical Vassal interprets the role of the Traveler as entirely negative: the sword shattered, and only the strength and courage of Dol Dorn allowed him to triumph. By contrast, the Children say that Dol Dorn was forced to create something entirely new {@i because} the blade shattered—the Traveler's goal wasn't to kill Dol Dorn, but rather to challenge him and force this moment of innovation. The Cazhaak tradition maintains that the chaos of the Traveler is a flame that tests and tempers traditions and beliefs, whether these define a society or an individual; the Traveler doesn't seek absolute anarchy, but they want you to constantly challenge your beliefs and abandon traditions that have outlived their usefulness. Under this interpretation, the Traveler is ultimately a positive force, though they force you to live in interesting times. However, most Vassals dismiss this and see the Traveler solely as a bringer of misfortune and mischief."

But in the traditions of the Children, the Traveler is the guide who walks by your side when you choose the unknown road—because it's only by walking your own path that you can find yourself. \"Walk your own path\" and \"find yourself\" are important principles for those who honor the Traveler. Walking your own path can be embraced both literally and metaphorically. On the one hand, it's a faith that encourages a nomadic lifestyle, embracing the chaos of the road and seeking out new places and experiences. Beyond that, it's a simple directive not to let others control your life; trust your instincts and don't fear the unknown.",
										"Finding yourself can likewise be embraced on multiple levels. Identify your strengths and your passions, but beyond that, figure out who you want to be and become that person. While this is an easier directive for a changeling, Eberron's world of magic can make it a literal truth for anyone. {@spell Disguise self} and {@spell alter self} allow you to temporarily assume identities, but special versions of transmutation spells and rituals can allow you to permanently change any aspect of appearance or gender. Followers of the Traveler are urged not to feel bound by anyone's expectations—only you know who you are.",

With that said, most tricksters have no long-term agenda beyond chaos itself; their purpose is to light the fire, and how far it spreads or what it consumes is in the hands of fate.

Of course, the mentor decides what lesson you need to learn, and there's no promise you'll survive the ensuing strife. Mentors can also focus on guiding those who are in moments of crisis; just as they believe the Traveler is by their side in chaotic times, they take that role for others, trying to lead toward a positive outcome.

Artificers and artisans who invoke the Traveler pursue ideas that could change the world.

There's no question that the Mourning has forced change on the world—but it also shows the potential danger of meddling with forces we don't understand.

I'm not going to give them a {@item holy avenger} at first level, but perhaps the adventurers hear stories about a legendary blade early on. If they're fighting the Emerald Claw, Lady Illmarrow's chief lieutenant could be a {@creature death Knight} who lost the blade after breaking their oath—and the only way the party can ultimately defeat this enemy is by finding that forgotten blade and breaking the curse laid on it.

It's for this reason that you don't see a nation like Rhiavhaar or the Lhazaar Principalities thriving on the coasts around the Barren Sea. There's no fishing, nothing to draw people into the water; as a result, the people of Ohr Kaluun, Nulakesh, and the lands now known as Droaam largely ignore the Barren Sea.

								"Why is the Barren Sea so barren? Scholars of the Five Nations generally agree this is due to the sea's hypersalinity, though they're unsure what causes that phenomenon. The waters of the Barren Sea have almost ten times the salt content of the other seas of Eberron. Few plants or animals can survive in these waters. A side effect of this is that the waters of the Barren Sea are surprisingly buoyant; anyone swimming in the Barren Sea has advantage on checks made to stay afloat.",
								"But while the salt content explains why the sea is devoid of life, a larger question remains: why is the water so salty? Hypersalinity is usually caused by mineral deposits and closed bodies of water, but that's not a factor here—the sea isn't a bounded body of water and there are no known mineral deposits that could cause it. Near Sarlona, the barren waters begin beyond the island chain of Ohr Kaluun. Off the coast of Khorvaire, the barren water starts just west of Zarash Bay; currents should carry the deadly waters into the bay itself, but oddly, the hypersalinity remains within certain static boundaries. When the waters of the Barren Sea flow beyond its invisible bounds, the salinity almost immediately fades. Some sages theorize that the Barren Sea's effect is somehow created and sustained by a supernatural force—for while hypersalinity is typically a natural phenomenon, these waters defy all attempts to explain them.",
								"The mystery is further compounded by the fact that the majority of the Barren Sea is shielded from divination (including the psionic clairsentience techniques employed by Riedrans). Much to the bewilderment of scholars and sailors alike, a massive {@spell nondetection} effect blankets the barren waters and anything on them—and its effects begin and end almost precisely where the hypersalinity does. Sages can't explore the Barren Sea with {@spell scrying}, Tharashk prospectors can't sense what lies beneath the waves—even the {@spell commune} spell can't unlock the secrets of the Barren Sea.

Because Dal Quor is currently shaped by il-Lashtavar—the Darkness that Dreams—a kuo-toa's dreamscape is often one of nightmares, and this in turn shapes the way they interact with the world. Adventurers might meet a kuo-toa who has learned to resist this; perhaps one of the dreamseers has even touched il-Yannah and can channel positive dreams. However, as long as the kuo-toa remain linked to the Darkness that Dreams, their dreamscape will continue to attract nightmares."

										"A single kuo-toa might have the power to draw a wisp of dream into reality to create the effects of a {@spell minor illusion}. But as kuo-toa join together, their collective unconscious amplifies their dreams—and nightmares—and they can bring these things into reality. Kuo-toa cities are ruled by gods they have dreamed into being, but they didn't choose these gods; these deities are built from their fears. Every kuo-toa deity is unique, and they shape their cities to match their nature. These gods are the true \"sinister fiends that dwell in horrid cities beneath the waves,\" and they make harsh demands on their people. Beyond gods, the kuo-toa can dream otherworldly creations and horrors into existence—they may dream creatures with the abilities of krakens or aboleths (though not their exact shapes or motivations), or entirely new abominations. Such monsters might serve the local deity, or they could simply rise to the surface to prey on unwary travelers. So you never know what you'll find in the Barren Sea ... because the kuo-toa in the deep could dream up a unique nightmare that has never been seen before and will never be seen again.",
										"The power of these kuo-toa gods depends on the community they're tied to, since it's the kuo-toa themselves that dream them into existence. A small outpost might have a \"god\" with the power of a mere pit fiend. For the major cities, the DM could repurpose the statistics of existing archfiends; this would be a fine place to have a version of {@creature Demogorgon|MPMM} or {@creature Zariel|MPMM}, though I'd definitely give them some distinct kuo-toa flavoring. However, their power is definitely geographically limited; while Blibdolpoop/Demogorgon might be extremely powerful in their domain, they couldn't go attack Sharn.

Consider that in the Age of Giants, the Quor-Toa were in a realm close to Dal Quor, and yet the quori came to Xen'drik instead. Why not travel through this open gateway? Because the quori of the past feared the Quor-Toa, just as those of the present fear the kuo-toa. When the kuo-toa shape dreams, pulling the essence of Dal Quor into reality and bending it to their will, this includes molding the quori themselves—for the kuo-toa gods began as quori! Understanding this, it becomes clearer why the kuo-toa gods are so cruel and why kuo-toa society is gripped by nightmares; they're built on the foundation of il-Lashtavar. However, the quori are themselves helpless prisoners; the kuo-toa gods are formed from their essence, but the quori themselves are forced to play the roles that are set for them. This isn't something the kuo-toa do consciously, and they can't choose {@i not} to do it. But the quori are aware of the powers the kuo-toa wield, and they stay far away from the ocean depths."

										"The beginning of this article raised a question: why is the Barren Sea so barren? What causes the focused hypersalinity, and what blocks divination? Scholars on land have advanced many theories. Some say it's clearly the work of the dragons of Argonnessen, an epic curse like those unleashed against Xen'drik. Others assert it's obviously the handiwork of the daelkyr. Or maybe there's an unbound overlord in the water and this is its domain. All of these ideas are plausible; any of them {@i could} be true.",
										"But in my interpretation in this chapter, the Barren Sea itself is a nightmare of the kuo-toa. Collectively, they see the world as a barren place of death, and this shared nightmare actively poisons the waters above them. They've dreamed cruel and oppressive gods into existence from quori seeds, and these nightmare gods conceal their domain from prying mortals. Though the kuo-toa no longer suffer the acute distress of the cataclysm where their ancestors were torn from Dal Quor, their world can't be changed by a few friendly conversations. On the other hand, if Dal Quor itself were to change—if il-Lashtavar were to give way to il-Yannah and an Age of Light—perhaps the Great Light could heal the kuo-toa and life could return to the Barren Sea. And there could even be a band of kuo-toa champions who have learned to consciously wield their dreams and are fighting to drive this change; these could be valuable allies for any adventurers following the Path of Light.",

Whether merchant or warrior, githyanki view all interactions through the lens of conflict. Every situation has a winner and a loser, and the githyanki must always be the victors. This doesn't mean mindless aggression; the githyanki recognize the need to outwit their enemies, to employ careful strategies and preserve their limited resources. But they are always seeking a path to victory, and they have no compunction about taking anything they desire from the people around them. In the eyes of the githyanki, only their people are real. All the trappings of this age are just flawed reflections of their reality. This is one reason the githyanki raid other planes while leaving the other denizens of the Astral Plane alone. Even if the other exiles are from other realities, the githyanki recognize them as kindred in suffering—and beyond that, they prefer not to start battles on their home ground. So the gith are constantly raiding through the color pools, but they avoid the ruins and outposts of other immigrants on the Astral Sea.",

When hermitages or other structures are in areas that can be struck by psychic wind, the buildings are usually shielded against its effects—so if the wind is growing worse, see if you can find a safe shelter! The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} notes that \"a psychic wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas, minor musings, and subconscious fears,\" and a DM could decide that particular instances of the psychic wind are tied to especially catastrophic events. Perhaps one storm system is tied to the destruction of the reality of the githyanki, while another emerged following the devastation of the Mourning, carrying the memories of all who died in the disaster."
